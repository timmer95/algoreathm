ADDENDUM:

RADIOLOGIC STUDIES:  Radiologic studies also included a chest
CT, which confirmed cavitary lesions in the left lung apex
consistent with infectious process/tuberculosis.  This also
moderate-sized left pleural effusion.

HEAD CT:  Head CT showed no intracranial hemorrhage or mass
effect, but old infarction consistent with past medical
history.

ABDOMINAL CT:  Abdominal CT showed lesions of
T10 and sacrum most likely secondary to osteoporosis. These can
be followed by repeat imaging as an outpatient.

Service:  MICU and then to [**Doctor Last Name **] Medicine

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 81-year-old female
with a history of emphysema (not on home O2), who presents
with three days of shortness of breath thought by her primary
care doctor to be a COPD flare.  Two days prior to admission,
she was started on a prednisone taper and one day prior to
admission she required oxygen at home in order to maintain
oxygen saturation greater than 90%.  She has also been on
levofloxacin and nebulizers, and was not getting better, and
presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] Emergency Room.

In the [**Hospital3 **] Emergency Room, her oxygen saturation was
100% on CPAP.  She was not able to be weaned off of this
despite nebulizer treatment and Solu-Medrol 125 mg IV x2.

Review of systems is negative for the following:  Fevers,
chills, nausea, vomiting, night sweats, change in weight,
gastrointestinal complaints, neurologic changes, rashes,
palpitations, orthopnea.  Is positive for the following:
Chest pressure occasionally with shortness of breath with
exertion, some shortness of breath that is positionally
related, but is improved with nebulizer treatment.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. COPD.  Last pulmonary function tests in [**2117-11-3**]
demonstrated a FVC of 52% of predicted, a FEV1 of 54% of
predicted, a MMF of 23% of predicted, and a FEV1:FVC ratio of
67% of predicted, that does not improve with bronchodilator
treatment.  The FVC, however, does significantly improve with
bronchodilator treatment consistent with her known reversible
air flow obstruction in addition to an underlying restrictive
ventilatory defect.  The patient has never been on home
oxygen prior to this recent episode.  She has never been on
steroid taper or been intubated in the past.
2. Lacunar CVA.  MRI of the head in [**2114-11-4**]
demonstrates ""mild degree of multiple small foci of high T2
signal within the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres
as well as the pons, in the latter region predominantly to
the right of midline.  The abnormalities, while nonspecific
in etiology, are most likely secondary to chronic
microvascular infarction.  There is no mass, lesion, shift of
the normal midline strictures or hydrocephalus.  The major
vascular flow patterns are preserved.  There is moderate
right maxillary, moderate bilateral ethmoid, mild left
maxillary, minimal right sphenoid, and frontal sinus mucosal
thickening.  These abnormalities could represent an allergic
or some other type of inflammatory process.  Additionally
noted is a moderately enlarged subtotally empty sella
turcica"".
3. Angina:  Most recent stress test was in [**2118-1-3**]
going for four minutes with a rate pressure product of
10,000, 64% of maximum predicted heart rate without evidence
of ischemic EKG changes or symptoms.  The imaging portion of
the study demonstrated no evidence of myocardial ischemia and
a calculated ejection fraction of 84%.  The patient denies
angina at rest and gets angina with walking a few blocks.
Are alleviated by sublingual nitroglycerin.
4. Hypothyroidism on Synthroid.
5. Depression on Lexapro.
6. Motor vehicle accident with head injury approximately 10
years ago.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Hydrochlorothiazide 25 q.d.
2. Prednisone 60 mg, 50 mg, 40 mg, 20 mg.

ALLERGIES:  Norvasc leads to lightheadedness and headache.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives with her husband, Dr. [**Known lastname 1809**] an
eminent Pediatric Neurologist at [**Hospital3 1810**].  The
patient is a prior smoker, but has not smoked in over 10
years.  She has no known alcohol use and she is a full code.

PHYSICAL EXAM AT TIME OF ADMISSION:  Blood pressure 142/76,
heart rate 100 and regular, respirations at 17-21, and 97%
axillary temperature.  She was saturating at 100% on CPAP
with dry mucous membranes.  An elderly female in no apparent
distress.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Oropharynx
difficult to assess due to CPAP machine.  No evidence of
jugular venous pressure, however, the strap from the CPAP
machine obscures the neck exam.  Cranial nerves II through
XII are grossly intact.  Neck is supple without
lymphadenopathy.  Heart exam:  Tachycardic, regular, obscured
by loud bilateral wheezing with increase in the expiratory
phase as well as profuse scattered rhonchi throughout the
lung fields.  Positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender,
nondistended, obese, no masses.  Mild edema of the lower
extremities without clubbing or cyanosis, no rashes.  There
is a right hand hematoma.  Strength is assessed as [**5-9**] in the
lower extremities, [**5-9**] in the upper extremities with a normal
mental status and cognition.

LABORATORY STUDIES:  White count 19, hematocrit 41, platelets
300.  Chem-7:  127, 3.6, 88, 29, 17, 0.6, 143.  Troponin was
negative.  CKs were negative times three.  Initial blood gas
showed a pH of 7.4, pO2 of 66, pCO2 of 54.

Chest x-ray demonstrates a moderate sized hiatal hernia,
segmental atelectasis, left lower lobe infiltrate versus
segmental atelectasis.

EKG shows normal sinus rhythm at 113 beats per minute, normal
axis, no evidence of ST-T wave changes.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. COPD/dyspnea/pneumonia:  The patient was initially placed
on an aggressive steroid taper and admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit due to her difficulty with oxygenation
despite CPAP machine.  She was also given nebulizer
treatments q.4h. as well as chest PT.  The nebulizers were
increased to q.1h. due to the fact that she continued to have
labored breathing.

Due to persistent respiratory failure and labored breathing,
the patient was intubated on [**2118-6-7**] in order to improve
oxygenation, ventilation, and ability to suction.  A
bronchoscopy was performed on [**2118-6-7**], which demonstrated
marked narrowing of the airways with expiration consistent
with tracheomalacia.

On [**2118-6-9**], two silicone stents were placed, one in the left
main stem (12 x 25 and one in the trachea 16 x 40) by Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] under rigid bronchoscopy with general anesthesia.

On [**2118-6-11**], the patient was extubated to a cool mist shovel
mask and her oxygen was titrated down to 2 liters nasal
cannula at which time she was transferred to the medical
floor.  On the medical floor, the steroids were weaned to off
on [**2118-6-14**], and the patient was saturating at 97% on 2
liters, 92% on room air.

On [**2118-6-14**], the patient was seen again by the Interventional
Pulmonology service, who agreed that she looked much improved
and recommended that she go to pulmonary rehabilitation with
followup within six weeks' time status post placement of
stents in respiratory failure.

2. Cardiovascular:  The patient was ruled out for a MI.  She
did have another episode on the medical floor of chest pain,
which showed no evidence of EKG changes and negative
troponin, negative CKs x3.  She was continued on aspirin,
Imdur, and diltiazem for rate control per her outpatient
regimen.

3. Hypertension:  She was maintained on diltiazem and
hydrochlorothiazide with adequate blood pressure control and
normalization of electrolytes.

4. Hematuria:  The patient had intermittent hematuria likely
secondary to Foley placement.  The Foley catheter was
discontinued on [**2118-6-14**].  She had serial urinalyses, which
were all negative for signs of infection.

5. Hyperglycemia:  Patient was placed on insulin-sliding
scale due to hyperglycemia, which was steroid induced.  This
worked quite well and her glucose came back to normal levels
once the steroids were tapered to off.

6. Leukocytosis:  Patient did have a profound leukocytosis of
20 to 22 during much of her hospital course.  As the steroids
were tapered to off, her white blood cell count on [**2118-6-14**]
was 15,000.  It was felt that the leukocytosis was secondary
to both steroids as well as question of a left lower lobe
pneumonia.

7. For the left lower lobe pneumonia, the patient had
initially received a course of levofloxacin 500 p.o. q.d.
from [**2118-6-4**] to [**2118-6-10**].  This was restarted on [**2118-6-12**]
for an additional seven day course given the fact that she
still had the leukocytosis and still had marked rales at the
left lower lobe.

8. Hypothyroidism:  The patient was continued on outpatient
medical regimen.

9. Depression:  The patient was continued on Lexapro per
outpatient regimen.  It is recommended that she follow up
with a therapist as an outpatient due to the fact that she
did have a blunted affect throughout much of the hospital
course, and did appear clinically to be depressed.

10. Prophylaxis:  She was maintained on proton-pump inhibitor
with subQ Heparin.

11. Sore throat:  The patient did have a sore throat for much
of the hospital course post extubation.  This was treated
with Cepacol lozenges as well as KBL liquid (a solution
containing Kaopectate, Bismuth, and lidocaine) at bedtime.

12. Communication/code status:  The patient was full code
throughout her hospital course, and communication was
maintained with the patient and her husband.

13. Muscle weakness:  The patient did have profound muscle
weakness and was evaluated by Physical Therapy, and was found
to have impaired functional mobility, impaired
musculoskeletal performance, impaired gas exchange, impaired
endurance, impaired ventilation, and needed help with supine
to sit.  However, she was able to tolerate sitting in a chair
for approximately one hour.

On motor exam, her flexors and extensors of the lower
extremities were [**4-8**] at the knee, [**4-8**] at the ankle, [**4-8**] at
the elbows, and [**4-8**] hips.  It was felt that this weakness was
most likely due to a combination of steroid myopathy as well
as muscle atrophy secondary to deconditioning after a
prolonged hospital course.

14. Speech/swallow:  The patient had a Speech and Swallow
evaluation showing no evidence of dysphagia, no evidence of
vocal cord damage status post tracheal stent placement.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  The patient was able to oxygenate on
room air at 93% at the time of discharge.  She was profoundly
weak, but was no longer tachycardic and had a normal blood
pressure.  Her respirations were much improved albeit with
transmitted upper airway sounds.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient will be discharged to [**Hospital1 **]
for both pulmonary and physical rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Levothyroxine 75 mcg p.o. q.d.
2. Citalopram 10 mg p.o. q.d.

13. Trazodone 25 mg p.o. q.h.s. prn.
14. SubQ Heparin 5000 units subcutaneous b.i.d. until such
time that the patient is able to get out of bed twice a day.
15. Cepacol lozenges q.2h. prn.
16. Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q.d. for a seven day course to
be completed on [**2118-6-21**].
17. Kaopectate/Benadryl/lidocaine 5 mL p.o. b.i.d. prn, not
to be given around mealtimes for concern of dysphagia induced
by lidocaine.
18. Lorazepam 0.5-2 mg IV q.6h. prn.

FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  The patient is recommended to followup with
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1407**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1408**] within two weeks of leaving
of the hospital.  She is also recommended to followup with
the Interventional Pulmonary service for followup status post
stent placement.  She is also recommended to followup with a
neurologist if her muscle weakness does not improve within
one week on physical therapy with concern for steroid-induced
myopathy.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1. Tracheomalacia status post tracheal and left main stem
bronchial stent placement.
2. Hypertension.
3. Hypothyroidism.
4. Restrictive lung defect.
5. Depression.

History of Present Illness:
This 81 year old woman has a history of COPD. Over the past five

years she has had progressive difficulties with her breathing.
In
[**2118-6-4**] she was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for respiratory failure
due
to a COPD exacerbation. Due to persistent hypoxemia, she
required
intubation and a eventual bronchoscopy on [**2118-6-9**] revealed marked

narrowing of the airways on expiration consistent with
tracheomalacia.
She subsequently underwent placement of two
silicone stents, one in the left main stem and one in the
trachea. During the admission the patient had complaints of
chest
pain and ruled out for an MI. She was subsequently discharged to

[**Hospital1 **] for physical and pulmonary rehab. Repeat bronchoscopy
on
[**2118-8-1**] revealed granulation tissue at the distal right lateral
wall of the tracheal stent. There was significant malacia of the

peripheral and central airways with complete collapse of the
airways on coughing and forced expiration. Small nodules were
also noted on the vocal cords. She has noticed improvement in
her
respiratory status, but most recently has been in discussion
with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 951**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 952**] regarding possible tracheobronchial plasty

with mesh. Tracheal stents d/c [**2119-4-19**] in anticipation of
surgery.
In terms of symptoms, she describes many years of intermittent
chest pain that she describes as left sided and occurring at any

time. Currently, she notices it about three times a week, and
states that it seems to resolve after three nitroglycerin.
She currently is dependent on oxygen and wears 1.5-2 liters
around the clock. She has frequent coughing and brings up ""dark
sputum"".

tracheobronchomalacia s/p stent, presents with acute dyspnea
over several days, and lethargy. This morning patient developed
an acute worsening in dyspnea, and called EMS. EMS found patient
tachypnic at saturating 90% on 5L. Patient was noted to be
tripoding. She was given a nebulizer and brought to the ER.
.
According the patient's husband, she was experiencing symptoms
consistent with prior COPD flares. Apparently patient was
without cough, chest pain, fevers, chills, orthopnea, PND,
dysuria, diarrhea, confusion and neck pain. Her husband is a
physician and gave her a dose of levaquin this morning.
.
In the ED, patient was saturating 96% on NRB. CXR did not reveal
any consolidation. Per report EKG was unremarkable. Laboratory
evaluation revealed a leukocytosis if 14 and lactate of 2.2.
Patient received combivent nebs, solumedrol 125 mg IV x1,
aspirin 325 mg po x1. Mg sulfate 2 g IV x1, azithromycin 500 mg
IVx1, levofloxacin 750 mg IVx1, and Cefrtiaxone 1g IVx1. Patient
became tachpnic so was trialed on non-invasive ventilation but
became hypotensive to systolics of 80, so noninvasive was
removed and patient did well on NRB and nebulizers for about 2
hours. At that time patient became agitated, hypoxic to 87% and
tachypnic to the 40s, so patient was intubated. Post intubation
ABG was 7.3/60/88/31. Propafol was switched to
fentanyl/midazolam for hypotension to the 80s. Received 2L of
NS. On transfer, patient VS were 102, 87/33, 100% on 60% 450 x
18 PEEP 5. Patient has peripheral access x2.
.
In the ICU, patient appeared comfortable.

CXR ([**2124-7-21**]) - IMPRESSION: Hiatal hernia, otherwise
unremarkable. Limited exam.

Echo ([**2124-7-24**]) - There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with normal free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular systolic function. Moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

CXR ([**2124-8-5**]) - Kyphotic positioning. Compared with one day
earlier and allowing for technical differences, the right-sided
effusion may be slightly larger. Otherwise, no significant
change is detected. Again seen is retrocardiac opacity
consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation
and a small left effusion. As noted, a right effusion is again
seen, possibly slightly larger on the current examination, with
underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Doubt CHF.
Degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are noted.

Brief Hospital Course:
87 yo F with h/o CHF, COPD on 5 L oxygen at baseline,
tracheobronchomalacia s/p stent, presents with acute dyspnea
over several days, no s/p intubation for hypercarbic respiratory
failure.

# Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Presents with dyspnea, but no
clear cough or fevers. Per report, patient felt like this with
prior COPD exacerbations. Leukocytosis supports possible
pneumonia, but history and CXR not entirely consistent with
this. EKG with signs of demand, but ROMI negative. Sputum gram
stain unremarkable, but respitatory viral culture grew
parainfluenze type 3 on [**7-24**]. Patient was initially managed on
solumedrol 60 mg IV Q8H, and was eventually tapered. With no
evidence of pneumonia on CXR and sputum gram stain, antibiotics
were stopped [**7-25**]. Beta-agonists and anticholinergics were
continued around the clock. TTE revealed mild symmetric lvh with
normal ef, increased pcwp (>18mmHg), Normal RV, and moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. On [**7-26**], bronchoscopy
revealed collapsible, unremarkable airways. Patient had
difficulty weaning from the vent, and would become
interimittenty hypertensive to SBP 200s and tachypnic to the
50s. Patient was extubatied on [**7-27**] after passing SBT 0/5, but
required re-intubation 30 minutes later for worsening
secretions, lack of gag reflex, and tachypnea to the 50s. Of
note, on [**8-1**], the patient was found to have MRSA growing in
sputum samples. Although it was felt that this likely
represented colonization as opposed to true infection, the
patient was started on a course of vancomycin (which was stopped
after 5 days). After multiple discussions between the patient's
family and the ICU team, the patient's PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] the palliative
care service, the patient's family ultimately decided that she
would not want a tracheostomy. On [**2124-8-3**], extubation was pursued
again and was successful. After extubation, her respiratory
status improved and she was ultimately called out to the medical
floor. On the floor she was progressively weaned to 2LNC with
nebs (better than her baseline 5L @home). Because of clinical
exams revealing mild volume overload, she was intermittently
diuresed. She also experienced intermittent shortness of breath
with tachypnea but this was thought to be the result of attacks
of anxiety with tachypnea. After receiving prn morphine, her
breathing status would typically improve. A steroid taper was
begun. The patient should continue prednisone 30 mg daily for 3
more days, then 20 mg daily for 4 days, then 10 mg daily for 4
days, then 5 mg daily for 4 days, then stop.
.
# Upper GI bleeding: On [**7-22**], patient had coffee grounds from OG
tube. Lavage for approx 600ccs with clearance. GI perfomred EGD
which revealed esophagitis, ulcers and blood in the stomach
body, D2 diverticulum and large hiatal hernia. H pylori was
negative. Patient was continued on IV PPI, with plan for repeat
EGD in 8 weeks, and upper GI series once clinically improved
given abnormal anatomy on EGD. Her hematocrit remained stable
with no further episodes of upper GI bleeding throughout the
patient's hospitalization. On the floor she was switched to PO
pantoprazole twice daily. Aspirin was held.
.
# Weakness: The patient was found to have generalized weakness
at the end of her hospitalization. Neurology was consulted and
they felt it was likely due to a combination of steroid myopathy
and deconditioning from her prolonged bedbound status. A TSH was
checked which was normal. They recommended pulmonary and
physical rehab.
.
# CAD: History of LAD and RCA stenosis on Cath, but no stents.
Continued statin and beta blocker, but held aspirin for GI
bleeding (see above)
.
# Nutrition: Unable to pass NG without direct visualization due
to hiatal hernia. IR guided post pyloric NG tube was placed on
[**7-26**] for TFs and po medications. NG tube was pulled when patient
was extubated on [**2124-8-3**]. Speech and swallow were consulted
following the patient's extubation and she was eventually moved
to soft solids and thin liquids with 1:1 supervision.

# Goals of care: PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 1407**] was very involved in discussions
regarding patient's code status. Palliative care also followed
along with the patient. Ultimately, at the time of the patient's
extubation on [**2124-8-3**], it was decided that the patient would be
DNR/DNI (although this was later change). The patient's family
felt that she would not want a tracheostomy. It was decided that
she would not be reintubated and that, if her respiratory status
were to worsen after intubation, care would be focused on
comfort. However, her status improved in the MICU and on the
floor and it was then decided that she would remain DNR with
intubation (but no tracheostomy) if her breathing deteriorated.
After several days with stable or improved overall clinical
status, she was deemed suitable for rehabilitation. At the timem
of discharge, the patient's code status was do not resuscitate,
okay to intubate.

   RADIOLOGY
==================

CT scan C spine [**2162-3-3**]:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Fracture of the C6 as described involving the right pedicle
(extending to the inferior facet) and left lamina. Anterior
widening at the C6-7 disc space and mild widening of left C6-7
facet also noted. Prevertebral hematoma at C6 with likely
rupture of the anterior longitudinal ligament.

2.  Lucency in the right posterior C1 ring may represent a
chronic injury.
Likely old avulsion fracture at T2 pedicle on the left.

3. Ossification of both anterior and posterior longitudinal
ligaments with
compromise of the central spinal canal. Degenerative disease is
further
described above.

CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS ([**2162-3-3**])
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute injuries in the chest, abdomen, or pelvis.
2. Three discrete pleural fluid collections in the right
hemithorax, likely pseudotumors.
3. Small hypodense lesion in the pancreatic body is of unclear
etiology, may represent pseudicyst or cystic tumor. Further
evaluation with MRI may be performed on a non- emergent basis.
4. Bilateral renal cysts.
5. Foley catheter balloon inflated within the prostatic urethra.
Recommend emergent repositioning.

CT SINUS/MAXILLOFACIAL ([**2162-3-3**])
1. Bilateral nasal bone fractures.
2. Left frontal scalp hematoma with preseptal soft tissue
swelling. Question foreign body anterior to the left globe.
Recommend clinical correlation. Small amount of extraconal
hematoma in the superior aspect of the left orbit.
3. Linear lucency in the right posterior ring of C1. Correlate
with CT C- spine performed concurrently.

HEAD CT ([**2162-3-3**])
1. No acute intracranial hemprrhage.
2. Left frontal scalp hematoma.
3. Nasal bone fractures. Recommend correlation with report from
facial bone CT scan.
4. Lucency in the right posterior ring of C1. Please refer to
dedeicated CT C-spine for further detail.
5. Left cerebellar encephalomalacia, likely due to old
infarction.

CHEST [**2162-3-10**]
The Dobbhoff tube passes below the diaphragm with its tip most
likely terminating in the stomach. The bilateral pacemakers are
demonstrated with one lead terminating in right atrium and three
leads terminating in right ventricle. The patient is in mild
pulmonary edema with no change in the loculated pleural fluid
within the major fissure.

CT HEAD [**2162-3-11**]
1. A tiny amount of intraventricular hemorrhage layers along the
occipital horns of the ventricles bilaterally. Recommend followp
imaging.
2. Left frontal scalp hematoma has decreased in size.
3. Unchanged left cerebellar encephalomalacia.
4. Nasal bone fractures are better evaluated on dedicated
maxillofacial CT.

RIGHT SHOULDER X-RAY ([**2162-3-11**])
Mild glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis.
Nonspecific ossification projecting over the upper margin of the
scapular body and adjacent to the lesser tuberosity. Diagnostic
considerations include the sequela of chronic calcific bursitis,
intraarticular bodies, and/or calcific tendinitis of the
subscapularis tendon.
Increased opacity projecting over the right hemithorax and minor
fissure, better delineated on recent chest radiographs and chest
CT

RIGHT UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND ([**2162-3-13**])
1. Deep venous thrombosis in the right axillary vein, extending
proximally into the right subclavian vein, and distally to
involve the brachial veins, portion of the basilic vein, and the
right cephalic vein.
2. Likely 2.0 cm left axillary lymph node, with unusual
son[**Name (NI) 493**] features somewhat suspicious for malignancy.
Followup ultrasound is recommended in 4 weeks, and FNA/biopsy
may be considered at that time if no interval improvement.

[**2162-3-14**]
CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: There are small-to-moderate
bilateral pleural effusions, on the right with a loculated
appearance. There is associated compressive atelectasis. The
visualized portion of the heart suggests mild cardiomegaly.
There is no pericardial effusion. There is a 9-mm
hypoattenuating, well-defined lesion in the left lobe of the
liver (2:12) too small to accurately characterize but
statistically most likely representing a cyst. There are
bilateral, partially exophytic renal cysts. The spleen is normal
in size. There is a 5-mm hypoattenuating focus in the pancreatic
body, most likely representing focal fat. The gallbladder and
adrenal glands are unremarkable. An NG tube terminates in the
stomach. There is no ascites. The large and small bowel loops
appear unremarkable without wall thickening or pneumatosis. Oral
contrast material has passed into the ascending colon without
evidence of obstruction. There is no ascites and no free air.
There is a small pocket of air in the left rectus muscle,
tracking over a distance of approximately 10 cm.

CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The pelvic small and large bowel
loops, collapsed bladder containing Foley catheter and seminal
vesicles appear unremarkable. The prostate is enlarged,
measuring 5.9 cm in transverse diameter. The rectum contains a
moderate amount of dried stool. There is no free air or free
fluid.

BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions. There is
DISH of the entire visualized thoracolumbar spine. There also
are degenerative changes about the hip joints with large
acetabular osteophytes.

IMPRESSION:
1. Stable bilateral pleural effusions, loculated on the right.
2. New focus of air tracking within the left rectus muscle with
associated tiny amount of extraperitoneal air (2:53). No
associated stranding or fluid collection. Please correlate
clinically if this could be iatrogenic, such as due to s.q.
injections.
3. 5-mm hypoattenuating focus in the pancreatic body. This could
represent focal fat, although a cystic tumor cannot be excluded.
If this is of concern, then MRI is again recommended for further
evaluation.
4. Hypoattenuating focus in the left lobe of the liver, too
small to accurately characterize.
5. Bilateral partially exophytic renal cysts.
6. Moderate amount of dried stool within the rectum.

A wet read was placed and the pertinent findings were discussed
by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1831**] [**Name (STitle) 1832**] with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1833**] at 11:30 p.m. on [**2162-3-14**].

[**2162-3-16**]
VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW FINDINGS: Real-time video
fluoroscopic evaluation was performed after oral administration
of thin and puree consistency of barium, in conjunction with the
speech pathologist.

ORAL PHASE: Normal bolus formation, bolus control, AP tongue
movement, oral transit time, and no oral cavity residue.

PHARYNGEAL PHASE: There is normal swallow initiation and velar
elevation. There is mild-to-moderate impairment of laryngeal
elevation with absent epiglottic deflection. There is
moderate-to-severe increase in pharyngeal transit time. There is
residue in the valleculae and piriform sinuses with moderate
impairment of bolus propulsion. There was aspiration of both
thin and puree barium.

IMPRESSION: Aspiration of thin liquids and puree. For additional
information, please see the speech and swallow therapist's
report from the same day.

[**2162-3-18**] CT Head w/out:
FINDINGS: There is a small amount of blood layering in the
occipital horns of both lateral ventricles, unchanged though not
as dense given evolution. No new hemorrhage is identified. The
ventricles, cisterns, and sulci are enlarged secondary to
involutional change. Periventricular white matter hyperdensities
are sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemia. Encephalomalacia
in the left cerebellar hemisphere secondary to old infarction is
unchanged. The osseous structures are unremarkable. The
visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
Skin staples are noted along the superior- posterior neck
secondary to recent spinal surgery.

IMPRESSION: No interval change with a very small
intraventricular hemorrhage.

No discharge labs as patient CMO.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1829**] was seen at [**Hospital1 18**] after his fall from a height
of approximatly 10 feet.  CT scans of his chest, abdomen and
pelvis were negative for pathology.  CT scan of his C-spine
showed fracture of anterior and posterior elements at C6-7.  He
was also shown to have a right nasal bone fracture.

C-spine fracture: Mr. [**Known lastname 1829**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] two surgical
procedures to stabilized his c-spine.  [**2162-3-4**]: anterior
cervical decompression/fusion at C6-7.  [**2162-3-5**]: Cervical
laminectomy C6-C7 & T1 with Posterior cervical arthrodesis
C4-T1.  He tolerated the procedures well.  He was extubated
without complication.

After his surgical procedures, Mr. [**Known lastname 1829**] was transfered
to the medicine service at [**Hospital1 18**] for his medical care. While on

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right Craniotomy


History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname 622**] [**Known lastname 1836**] is a 62-year-old woman, with longstanding
history of rheumatoid arthritis, probable Sweet's syndrome, and
multiple joint complications requiring orthopedic interventions.
She was found to hve a right cavernous sinus and nasopharyngeal
mass.  She underwent a biopsy of hte nasopharyngeal mass by Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1837**] and the pathology, including flow
cytometry,
was reactive for T-cell lymphoid hyperplasia only.

She has a longstanding history of rheumatoid arthritis that
involved small and large joints in her body.  Her disease is
currently controlled by abatacept, hydroxychloroquine, and
methotrexate.  She also has a remote history of erythematous
nodules at her shins, dermatosis (probable Sweet's disease),
severe holocranial headache with an intensity of [**9-28**], and
dysphagia.  But her symptoms resolved with treatment for
autoimmune disease.  Please refer additional past medical
history, past surgical history, facial history, and social
history to the initial note on [**2171-11-4**].

She cam to the BTC for discussion about management of her right
cavernous sinus mass that extends into the middle cranial fossa.


She had a recent head CT at the [**Hospital1 756**] and Woman's Hospital on
[**2171-11-29**], when she went for a consultation there.
She is neurologically stable without headache, nausea, vomiting,
seizure, imbalance, or fall. She has no new systemic complaints.

Her neurological problem started [**9-/2171**] when she experienced
frontal pressure-like sensations.  There was no temporal
pattern;
but they may occur more often in the evening.
She had fullness in her ear and she also had a cold coinciding
to
the onset of her headache.  By late [**Month (only) 359**] and early [**2171-10-21**], she also developed a sharp pain intermittently in the
right
temple region.
She did not have nausea, vomiting, blurry vision, imbalance, or
fall.  A gadolinium-enhanced head MRI, performed at [**Hospital1 346**] on [**2171-10-30**], showed a bright mass
involving the cavernous sinus.

Past Medical History:
She has a history of rheumatoid arthritis unspecified
dermatosis, right knee replacement, left hip replacement, and
fusion of subtalar joint, and resection of a benign left parotid
gland tumor.


Social History:
She is married.  She had smoked for approximately a year and a
half when she was younger, but is not currently smoking.  She
has approximately one glass of wine per week.  She is retired
but was employed as a teacher.


Family History:
Cancer, diabetes, hearing loss, and heart disease.


Physical Exam:
AF VSS
HEENT normal
no LNN
Neck supple.
RRR
CTA
NTTP
warm peripherals

Neurological Examination:  Her Karnofsky Performance Score is
100.  She is neurologically intact.


Pertinent Results:
MRI [**3-5**]
Right middle cranial fossa mass likely represents a meningioma
and is stable since MRI of [**2172-2-11**]. The previously seen
midline nasopharyngeal mass has decreased in size since MRI of
[**2168-2-11**]. Direct visual inspection would be helpful for
further assessment of the nasopharyngeal mass.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient presented electively for meningioma resection of [**3-5**].
She tolerated the procedure well and was extubated in the
operating room. She was trasnported to the ICU post-operatively
for management. She had no complications and was transferred to
the floor and observed for 24 hours. Prelim path is consistent
with meningioma.
She has dissolvable sutures, and will need to come to
neurosurgery clinic in [**6-28**] days for wound check only.
She will need to be scheduled for brain tumor clinic. She will
complete Decadron taper on [**3-10**] and then restart her maintenance
dose of prednisone. She will also be taking Keppra for seizure
prophlyaxis.
Her neurologic examination was intact with no deficits at
discharge. She was tolerating regular diet. She should continue
to take over the counter laxatives as needed.

History of Present Illness:
82 yo F with CAD, CHF, HTN, recent PE ([**10-17**]), who presents from
rehab with hypoxia and SOB despite Abx treatment for PNA x 3
days. The patient was in rehab after being discharged from here
for PE. She was scheduled to be discharged on [**12-6**]; on the day
prior to discharge she deveoped fever, hypoxia, and SOB. CXR
showed b/t lower lobe infiltrates. She was started on levoflox
and ceftriaxone on [**12-5**]. When she became hypoxic on NC they
brought her in to the ED.

O2 90% on 3L. She was started on vanc and zosyn for broader
coverage, tylenol, and 2L NS.
.
The patient reports having sweats and cough before admission.
She complains of SOB and some upper back pain. She denies chest
pain, URI sx, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, or dysuria. Of note she
had had a rash and was given prednisone for 7 days, ending
[**12-3**]. The rash was speculated to be due to coumadin, but she
was able to be continued on coumadin.

[**2112-12-8**] PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The heart size and
mediastinal contours are within normal limits. No definite
pleural effusions are seen. There is diffusely increased
interstitial opacity disease, predominantly in the lower lung
zones. No pneumothorax seen. The osseous structures are stable.
A hiatal hernia is noted. Tiny left pleural effusion is noted.

IMPRESSION: Diffusely increased interstitial opacities. This
appearance is consistent with pulmonary vascular congestion
superimposed upon chronic interstitial changes.
.
[**2112-12-9**] IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**11-19**] and
[**12-8**]:

Severe progressive interstitial abnormality accompanied by
pulmonary and mediastinal vascular congestion is most likely
edema, but severe interstitial pneumonia either infectious or
drug related could simulate these findings. Chronic hiatus
hernia unchanged.


Brief Hospital Course:
82 yo F with CAD, CHF, HTN, recent PE ([**10-17**]), who presents from
rehab with PNA and hypoxia.
.
Chest x-ray revealed bilateral infiltrates. Patient was started
on Zosyn and vancomycin for pneumonia. Her fluid status was
closely monitored given her underlying CHF. On admission her
daughters were in disagreement over her code status and her
original long standing DNR/DNI status was changed to allow for
intubation if needed. However, when the patient's respiratory
status continued to decline to the point of need for intubation,
the patient refused intubation. Her family was notified and
agreed that their mother's wishes should be fulfilled.  She was
started on IV morphine then converted to morphine drip on HD #3
for comfort and all other medications were discontinued. Her
family was at her bedside and their Rabbi was called. She died
on [**2112-12-10**] at 2:20 pm. An autopsy was offered, but the family
declined.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2-25**] Left Craniotomy for mass resection


History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 1852**] is a 62-year-old left-handed man who is here for a
follow up of his left sphenoid meningioma.  I last saw him on
[**2149-11-17**] and his head CT showed growth of the left sphenoid
meningioma.  He is seizure free.  Today, he is here with his
wife
and daughter.  [**Name (NI) **] does not have headache, nausea, vomiting,
urinary incontinence, or fall.

His neurological problem began on [**2142-6-22**] when he became
confused and disoriented in a hotel bathroom.  At that time, he
was visiting his daughter for a wedding.  His wife found him
slumped over in the bath tube.  According to her, his eyes
looked
funny.  He could not stand up.  His verbal output did not make
sense.  He was brought to [**Doctor First Name 1853**] Hospital in Placentia,
CA.  He woke up 7 to 8 hours later in the emergency room.  He
felt very tired after the event.  He was hospitalized from
[**2142-6-22**] to [**2142-6-25**].  He had a cardiac pacemaker placement due
to irregular heart rate and bradycardia.  He also had a head MRI
that showed a less than 1 cm diameter sphenoid meningioma.


Past Medical History:
Cardiac arrhythmia as noted above, has a
pacemaker in place, prostate cancer with prostatectomy, and
hypertension.


Social History:
Lives with his wife.  Retired, works parttime
driving a school bus.


Family History:
NC

Physical Exam:
Temperature is 97.8 F.  His blood pressure
is 150/92.  Pulse is 80.  Respiration is 16.  His skin
has full turgor.  HEENT is unremarkable.  Neck is supple.
Cardiac examination reveals regular rate and rhythms.  His lungs
are clear.  His abdomen is soft with good bowel sounds.  His
extremities do not show clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.

Neurological Examination:  His Karnofsky Performance Score is
100.  He is awake, alert, and oriented times 3.  There His
language is fluent with good comprehension.  His recent recall
is
intact.  Cranial Nerve Examination:  His pupils are equal and
reactive to light, 4 mm to 2 mm bilaterally.  Extraocular
movements are full.  There is no nystagmus.  Visual fields are
full to confrontation.  Funduscopic examination reveals sharp
disks margins bilaterally.  His face is symmetric.  Facial
sensation is intact bilaterally.  His hearing is intact
bilaterally.  His tongue is midline.  Palate goes up in the
midline.  Sternocleidomastoids and upper trapezius are strong.
Motor Examination:  He does not have a drift.  His muscle
strengths are [**5-16**] at all muscle groups.  His muscle tone is
normal.  His reflexes are 0 in upper and lower extremities
bilaterally.  His ankle jerks are absent.  His toes are
down going.  Sensory examination is intact to touch and
proprioception.  Coordination examination does not reveal
dysmetria.  His gait is normal.  He can do tandem.  He does not
have a Romberg.

PHYSICAL EXAM UPON DISCHARGE:
non focal
incision c/d/i, dissolvable sutures

Pertinent Results:
[**2-25**] CT Head: IMPRESSION:
1. Likely meningioma along the greater [**Doctor First Name 362**] of the left sphenoid
bone,
measuring 18 mm in diameter, unchanged since the most recent
study of [**11/2149**], with reactive bony changes, as above.
2. Bifrontal cortical atrophy, which has progressed slightly
over the series of studies since the earliest studies of [**2142**].

[**2-25**] CT Head: IMPRESSION:
Expected post-operative changes with the left frontal craniotomy
including
subcutaneous air and soft tissue swelling, moderate
pneumocephalus overlying predominantly the bilateral frontal
lobes, and foci of hemorrhage in the surgical bed. No evidence
of residual tumor on this non contrast CT.

[**2-26**] CXR: FINDINGS: The lung volumes are rather low. There is
moderate cardiomegaly without evidence of overt pulmonary edema.
No areas of atelectasis or pneumonia. Right pectoral pacemaker
in situ, with correct lead placement.


[**2-28**] Head CT /c contrast: IMPRESSION: Status post left frontal
craniotomy changes with improvement of pneumocephalus and stable
3 mm left to right midline shift; focus of hemorrhage
with/without residual tumor in the resection bed is similar in
appearance to prior exam but now with more surrounding vasogenic
edema. Stable appearance of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Followup to
assess for residual tumor/ interval change.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient presented electively on [**2-25**] for left sided craniotomy
for mass resection. he tolerated the procedure well and was
taken to the Trauma ICU post-operatively still intubated.
Shortly thereafter he was deemed fit for extubation which was
done without difficulty. At post-op check he was neurologically
intact.
On [**2-26**] he was neurologically intact and cleared for transfer to
the stepdown unit. This did not happen due to bed shortage. A CT
with contrast was ordered for post op evaluation.
On [**2-27**] he was again stable and cleared for transfer to the
floor. Decadron taper was initiated. He was seen by PT and
cleared for discharge home.
On [**2-28**] the patient was being prepped for discharge but was
noted to have intermittent heart rate in the 130-170's. His

Pathology Report from [**2118-8-10**]:
DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Brain, left frontal (A):
    1.  Vascular malformation consistent with arteriovenous
malformation
    of cortical [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and white matter with radiation induced
fibrinoid
    necrosis.
    2.  Focal hemosiderin deposition suggesting prior
hemorrhages.
2.  Left frontal radionecrosis and residual AVM (B):
    1.  Vascular malformation consistent with arteriovenous
malformation
    of cortical [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and white matter with radiation induced
fibrinoid
    necrosis.
    2.  Focal hemosiderin deposition suggesting prior
hemorrhages.
Clinical:  Radionecrosis.

CT Head post-op [**8-10**]:
FINDINGS: There is a left-sided frontal craniotomy with surgical
resection of the enhancing ""mass"" noted in previous studies.
There is extensive confluent hypodensity in the left
frontoparietal region, that likely represents post-radiation
vasogenic edema with resultant 8.5-mm shift of normally-midline
structures, not significantly changed from the previous MR.
There is a tiny focus of hyperdensity in the postoperative field
which may represent a small amount of hemorrhage. There is
expost-operative pneumocephalus and subcutaneous air noted.

IMPRESSION: Status post left craniotomy and resection of AVM and
possible
""mass""-like radiation necrosis, with small hyperdense focus in
the operative bed, likely representing very small hemorrhage.
Extensive vasogenic edema persists.

resection. Her Post-op head CT was negative for bleeding. She
remained intubated immediately post-op. She was weaned and
extubated on [**8-11**] and did very well neurologically. The patient
was transferred out of the ICU later that day. She was
ambulating without difficulty, her pain was well-controlled, and
she was taking in food with no nausea/vomiting. Her
post-operative MRI was done on [**8-12**] and showed expected
post-operative changes. She was discharged on [**2118-8-12**].

Attending:[**Doctor Last Name 1857**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central venous line insertion (right internal jugular vein)

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1858**] is an 84 yo man with moderate aortic stenosis (outside
hospital echo in [**2124**] with [**Location (un) 109**] 1 cm2, gradient 28 mmHg, moderate
mitral regurgitation, mild aortic insufficiency), chronic left
ventricular systolic heart failure with EF 25-30%, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, CAD s/p CABG in [**2099**] with
SVG-LAD-Diagonal, SVG-OM, and SVG-RPDA-RPL, with a re-do CABG in
[**9-/2117**] with LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM, SVG-diagonal, and SVG-RCA. He also
has severe peripheral arterial disease s/p peripheral bypass
surgery. He presented to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital ER this morning with
shortness of breath and chest pain and was found to be in heart
failure.

He states he was in his usual state of health until 10:30 last
evening when he woke up feeling cold; 1 hour later he developed
moderate to severe sharp chest pain radiating across his chest
associated with nausea, diaphoresis, and dypsnea. The pain was
fairly constant and did not resolve until he was given sL NTG at
6 am by EMS. He has been pain free since. Presenting vitals BP
109/66, HR 71, O2 sat 88% on RA. CXR showed congestive heart
failure; initial troponin-I was mildly elevated at 0.4, CK 70.
He given aspirin and furosemide 80 mg IV (with ~600cc diuresis),
Nitropaste [**1-3**]"", and Lovenox 80 mg SQ. During the ambulance
transfer to the [**Hospital1 18**], he also received ~500 cc IVF for ? low
BP).

On further questioning, Mr. [**Known lastname 1858**] has very poor exercise
tolerance due to knee pain that he attributes to osteoarthritis.
But he says that he gets chest pain (similar to pain he had last
night) with fairly minimal exertion (picking up his 11 lb cat,
carrying 1 gallon jug of water, first getting up from sitting to
walk outside or to walk to the bedroom). The pain is associated
with dyspnea and is relieved with few minutes rest. His symptoms
occur about every day to every other day and have been stable
over the past year. He denies orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, but does endorse exertional dyspnea (he cannot identify
the amount of exertion required). Currently, he is dyspneic and
feels somewhat better sitting up; he reports no chest pain.

ROS is also positive for a nose bleed requiring ED visit several
months ago (and cessation of Plavix for a few days), and
currently gross hematuria after Foley placement and Lovenox.

Past Medical History:
1. Coronary artery disease s/p CABG twice (vide infra).
2. Hypertension.
3. Diabetes mellitus.
4. Hyperlipidemia.
5. Peripheral arterial disease with occluded left common iliac
artery, S/P right iliac artery stenting and femoral-to-femoral
bypass, further angioplasty to the right profunda.
5. Ischemic cardiomyopathy and chronic LV systolic heart
failure, reported LVEF 25-30%.
6. Moderate-severe aortic stenosis.
7. Osteoarthritis.

CAD: Diabetes, Dyslipidemia, Hypertension

Cardiac History: CABG in [**2099**] (SVG-LAD-Diagonal, SVG-OM, and
SVG-RPDA-RPL), with a re-do CABG in [**9-/2117**] (LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM,
SVG-diagonal, and SVG-RCA)

Percutaneous coronary intervention, in [**2120**] anatomy as follows:
Patent SVG to OM1, patent SVG to PDA which filled the distal PDA
as well as the R-PL via a jump segment. Stump occlusion of a
graft presumably to the right system as well as one stump that
could be documented of a graft to the left. Other SVG's were not
able to be selectively engaged. Supravalvular aortography
demonstrated no other patent grafts. Patent LIMA to mid-LAD,
which also back-perfused the diagonal via a patent jump graft
that was interposed between the LAD and the diagonal.

Social History:
Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco
use. There is no history of alcohol abuse.

Family History:
There is extensive family history of early coronary disease
(father died of MI at 44, one brother died in 40's, one in 50's,

new, most likely part of the heart failure.   Left and right
retrocardiac opacities consistent with atelectasis.

ECHO [**2125-2-11**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with akinesis of the basal half of the inferior and inferolaterl
walls. There is mild hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF
= 25-30 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size
is normal. with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is severe
aortic valve stenosis (area 0.6 cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**1-3**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior report (images
unavailable of [**2119-5-8**], left ventricular systolic function is now
depressed and the severity of aortic stenosis has increased.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 84 yo man with CAD s/p CABG twice with daily
angina, presenting with chest pain, dyspnea, and congestive
heart failure.

# CAD: The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup
and treatment of chest pain. A chest X-ray performed on
admission showed moderate-severe pulmonary edema. He did have a
stably elevated troponin thought to be related to acute heart
failure or demand ischemia. He was started on a Lasix drop at 10
mg/hr for initiation of diuresis. He initially tolerated this
well, however at approximately 8 pm on [**2125-2-10**], Mr. [**Known lastname 1858**] was
transferred from the floor to the CCU after complaining of chest
pain when he was sitting in bed after dinner. As he was being
evaluated by the housestaff, he became unresponsive and
developed pulseless electrical arrest. Chest compressions were
started, but within approximately 2 minutes, he became
responsive and regained a palpable pulse. His rhythm appeared to
be atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate initially in the
50s but rising to the 110's. Review of his telemetry showed that
he had developed atrial fibillation earlier in the evening
without obvious ventricular arrhythmias immediately prior to his
arrest (which was attributed to a vasovagal episode in the
setting of heart failure and aortic stenosis).  On transfer to
the CCU, he was started on levophed for hypotension and
amiodarone IV for AFib. Chest x-ray on [**2125-2-10**] showed interval
worsening of pulmonary edema, bilateral pleural effusions and
bibasilar atelectasis.  At this time his cardiac enzymes became
very elevated with EKG changes consistent of a NSTEMI with a CK
to 1006 and troponin to 3.82. On [**2125-2-11**], he had a transthoracic
echocardiogram which showed moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the basal half of the
inferior and inferolateral walls. LVEF was 25-30 %, with severe
aortic stenosis and [**1-3**]+ mitral regurgitation. He was
aggressively diuresed with an IV Lasix drip with improvement in
his oxygen requirement and chest x-ray.  Levophed was
discontinued on [**2-12**], and blood pressures remained stable off
pressors with MAP's 60 - 70.  On [**2125-2-13**], he was transferred
back to the floor team on PO amiodarone. He remained in normal
sinus rhythm on telemetry on po amiodarone, and diuresis was
continued with a Lasix drip with good urine output and
improvement of renal function. He remained asymptomatic with no
shortness of breath or chest pain after transfer. He was
maintained on a heparin drip bridging to Coumadin for paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation. His metoprolol was held for hypotension in
the ICU and relative hypotension with SBP in 90s and low 100s
upon transfer to the floor. ACE-inhibitor was held due to
relative hypotension and renal insufficiency with Creat 1.7. A
cardiac surgery consult deemed him an acceptable candidate for a
3rd open heart surgery for aortic valve replacement pending
re-assessment of his coronary anatomy. The intermediate-term
plan was to allow recovery from the current episode and
discussion as an outpatient with his primary cardiologist
regarding the risks and benefits of aortic valve replacement.

On [**2-16**], the patient became hypotensive to SBPs to
60s-70s after getting into a chair after breakfast. He was given
1L NS with no response in BP. The patient was mentating but
became short of breath with IVF. He had worsening EKG changes.
He was started on Levophed without improvement in his blood
pressure. He was brought to the catherization laboratory for
potential emergent aortic valvuloplasty and was intubated. At
that point, he suffered a PEA arrest and could not be
resuscitated. He was pronounced deceased at 12:33pm.

# Pump: As above. The patient had severe pulmonary edema with
initial exam revealing crackles throughout his lung fields. He
was treated with a Lasix drip which was transitioned on [**2-16**] to
po Lasix 80 mg po twice daily.

# Rhythm: Patient was in NSR on admission. On HD #2, he had
chest pain, then went into PEA arrest as described above.
Telemetry showed atrial fibrillation prior to the event. In the
CCU, he was started on amiodarone 400 mg po tid to be tapered
over the subsequent weeks.

# Acute renal failure: Renal function initially declined
(creatinine to 2.1), then improved on Lasix gtt, but stayed 1.7
- 1.9 (above baseline of 1.3).

# Hematuria: He had hematuria (no clots) after traumatic Foley
placement at the outside hospital. The catheter was removed on
[**2-16**] with gradual resolution of hematuria.

# Diabetes: Due to acute renal failre, metformin was
discontinued and the patient was maintained on a Humalog sliding
scale with 30 units of Lantus at bedtime.

# Hematoma. The patient developed a small hematoma at the site
of his right internal jugular venous access after catheter
removal. This was treated with local compression.

Brief Hospital Course:
84 yo f w/ h/o CRI, htn, h/o nephrotic syndrome, w/ diarrhea,
c.diff pos at rehab, failure to respond to flagyl, w/ elev wbc,
and negative ct. A brief-problem based hospital course is
outlined below.

1) presumed c.diff infxn- Admitted and started on p.o. vancomyin
and IV metronidazole, w/ addition of levofloxacin for broad
spectrum coverage given recent abd surgery. Cholestyramine was
initially given for toxin binding. WBC was 30 on admission and
trended down with ABX; however, C.diff toxin neg x5, so
diagnosis remains presumptive.  C. diff B toxin was sent and was
negative as well. She completed a 3 week course of PO vanco and
IV flagyl antibiotics, which was completed on [**5-14**]. She
subsequently remained afebrile without further diarrhea, and was
able to tolerate PO's.

2) [**Name (NI) 1866**] Pt began having episodes of BRBPR on [**4-25**] with
resultant slow HCT drop. GI and surgery were consulted. Pt had
no abdominal pain, but given recent surgery and low albumin, we
were concerned that the bleed may be evidence of ischemic bowel
or dehiscence. Pt was also having intermittent episodes of
tachycardia, raising the possibility that she was having embolic
phenomena with acute ischemia. However, she had no abdominal
pain to suggest this. Colonoscopy was done on [**4-30**], showing
severe c dif vs. ischemic bowel. Surgery found that pt was not
surgical candidate and believed her bleeding and mucosal damage
was [**2-29**] c dif and would continue to improve. Biopsy results
showed no evidence of c.dif, but given pt's tenuous status, po
vanco and iv flagyl were continued while awaiting toxin B. It is
quite possible that the mucosal changes seen on colonoscopy were
the result of C dif infxn, which had been treated w/ABX and
resolved, leaving the mucosae to heal. As well, GI felt there
may be a superimposed ischemic insult. No further work-up was
performed since she had good clinical resolution of her colitis,
following completion of cdiff treatment.

2) acute renal failure w/ CRI-  Renal team was consulted on
admisison.  Baseline cr is approx 2.0.  On admission this was
significantly elevated to 4.1.  FENA was c/w prerenal etiology
and patient had R IJ placed in ED, started on NS for volume
resusciation.  This was undertaken slowly given that pt had an
albumin of 1.4 and pleural effusions were noted on CT.  Fluids
were changed to 1/2NS w/ bicarb on HD2. Cr trended down each day
and the patient has maintained oxygenation.   Alb/cr ratio not
c/w nephrotic range proteinuria- thus it was felt that the low
alb was likely multifactorial. Pt initially required boluses of
500cc NS to maintain Uop ~20-30cc/hr. With hydration and
improvement in her diarrhea, her Cr steadily decreased and
returned to baseline of 1.6. She was seen by renal who felt that
her increase in creatinine may have been secondary to
ATN/hypotension and recommended avoiding aggressive
overdiuresis. She did subsequently require aggressive diuresis
given her rapid afib/chf with lasix and niseritide drips.
However her creatinine remained at baseline of 1.7-2.0 with
diuresis. She did develop a transient metabolic alkalosis, which
was felt likely from volume contraction alkalosis. Therefore her
lasix was weaned to 40mg daily and her bicarb trended back down
to 30. Her creatinine was stable at 1.6 at the time of
discharge.

3) [**Name (NI) 1867**] Pt was noted to be mildly thrombocytopenic
on admisison.   Unclear why it was low when patient presented.
Most likely [**2-29**] extreme inflammatory/SIRS response (given elev
lactate on admission). Her PLT count dropped to 95 and DIC
workup and HIT Ab were sent, both negative. Her PLT count rose
as her clinical condition improved and remained in normal range
for the duration of her hosital course.

4) HTN - Pt's baseline SBP is in the 180s-200s range. On
admission, BP was low [**2-29**] 3rd spacing and early sepsis. Her BP
responded to fluids and she remained relatively normotensive.
She was continued on metoprolol for HR/BP control and
isordil/hydral was added for afterload reduction.

5) CHF - Evidence of CHF on initial CXR. Her EF was found to be
40% (previously normal), bringing up concern for ischemic event
precipitating her failure. In support of this she was noted to
have wall motion abnormalities on ECHO with inferoseptal/basal
hypokinesis. Diagnostic catheritization was not performed due to
her renal insufficiency and decompensated CHF. She was managed
medically, and on [**5-10**] the CHF service was consulted for
management. She was initiated on aggressive diuresis with IV
lasix for goal -1.5L per day. She was transferred to the CCU
briefly on [**5-12**] for more tailored therapy and diuresis for her
CHF (lasix boluses and nesiritide) with good effect (negative
approximately 500 cc overnight). She was transferred back to the
floor on lasix boluses.

Due to continued evidence of volume overload she was given 160mg
IV [**Month/Year (2) 1868**] + started on lasix drip at 10mg/hr. Then started
nesiritide [**Month/Year (2) 1868**] (1mcg/kg) followed by gtt at 0.01mcg/kg/min.
Diuresed well to this and maintained BP well, however after
increasing natrecor to 0.015, went back into rapid afib. Stopped
natrecor on [**5-17**]. Stopped lasix gtt on [**5-18**] given persistent
good diuresis. Now tapered down to 40mg daily lasix/day +
afterload reduction w/ Isordil/Hydral on [**5-22**]. At the time of
discharge, she was felt to be euvolemic with goal of matching
ins and outs daily. We will continue her on this regimen upon
discharge.

7.  Atrial fibrillation: Initially converted from RAF by medical
cardioversion performed with procainamide gtt in the CCU at
13mg/kg/hr x10min load followed by 2mg/hr for 2h trial. Became
hypotensive to 60's systolic, but subsequently recovered. Then
again went into RAF on [**5-17**] early am. Initially HR controlled w/
IV lopressor/IV dilt. Then [**Hospital 1869**] medical cardioversion w/
procainamide. Became hypotensive to 70's systolic after about 10
minutes on procainamide [**Last Name (LF) 1868**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] this was stopped and her blood
pressures normalized. She then converted 10 min later to NSR.
She has been in NSR the remainder of her hospital course. She is
not on coumadin due to risk for bleed. In addition, amiodorone
was discussed as a medical option for continued rythm control.
However, given the side effect profile, the family and patient
were more comfortable with holding off on adding amiodorone at
this time. They understand that there is a higher risk of
conversion back to atrial fibrillation and increased risk for
stroke without amiodorone.  We will continue rate control with
metoprolol as mentioned at 25mg TID, and may titrate up as
needed to maintain HR <80.

8. CAD- wall motion abnormalities on ECHO w/ inferoseptal/basal
HK. currently chest pain free. continuing with medical
management. On statin/b-blocker. No plan for cath at this time
given her renal insuff/co-morbiditites. Also holding off on
aspirin currently given her bleed risk. This will be
re-addressed as an outpatient through her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

9. Anemia- Initially had episode of GI bleed with blood loss
anemia requiring 3 units of packed red blood cells. Hematocrit
subsequently normalized. However, she subsequently was noted to
have a low, but stable, hematocrit at 28-29. Repeat stool
guaiacs were all negative and she had no further evidence of
bleed or hemolysis. Iron stores were also found to be within
normal limits, with low TIBC and high ferritin suggesting anemia
of chronic disease. This was felt likely secondary to chronic
renal insufficiency. She was started on EPO 2,000 Units q m,w,fr
on [**5-22**]. The goal transfusion criteria would be 30 given her
history of CAD, however, we have held off on further transfusion
at this time given her known CHF with recent severe volume
overload. We have set transfusion goal at hct>28, and transfused
with 1 unit packed red blood cells and 20mg IV lasix for hct
<28.

10. tachypnea- Resolved. Her transient tachypnea was felt likely
secondary to volume overload. There was no evidence of
infiltrate by CXR. Her ABG at the time on [**5-15**] showed
7.29/43/99. Her respiratory status subsequently improved that
same day on [**5-15**] following IV lasix and atrovent nebulizers.
Avoided albuterol nebulizers over concern for tachycardia.

11. F/E/N- Started on TPN for nutritional supplementation. She
also had a swallow study which showed ability to tolerated
regular solids and thin liquids. She has been taking in PO's as
tolerated, but has continued to require TPN to reach nutritional
goals. This will be continued upon discharge at rehab.

Service:  TRAUMA SURGERY

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 2212**] is a 37-year-old
male who was stabbed by a four inch knife to the left upper
abdomen.  In the field, his blood pressure was 120/palpable,
heart rate 120.  A pressure dressing was applied to the
wound.  Reportedly, the knife penetrated about 1.5 inches.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  HIV positive for 21 years.
2.  History of intravenous drug abuse.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Congestive heart failure.
5.  Right above the knee amputation after being hit by a
truck in the past.
6.  Tricuspid regurgitation.

3.  Bactrim Double Strength.
4.  Lasix.
5.  Methadone.
6.  Lopressor.
7.  Prilosec.
8.  Risperdal.
9.  Aldactone.
10. Folate.
11. Multivitamins.
12. Thiamine.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has an allergy to penicillin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
97.3, heart rate 116, blood pressure 140/palpable,
respiratory rate 16, pulse oximetry of 100%.  General:  He
was alert and oriented times three with a GCS of 15.  HEENT:
Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Extraocular motions were intact.
The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation.  The oropharynx was clear.  The TMs were
clear.  Chest:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally with no
subcutaneous air noted.  Cardiac:  No murmurs, rubs, or
gallops.  Regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen:  There was a 1.5
cm left upper quadrant wound, otherwise diffusely tender.
Back:  No step-off.  No deformities.  Nontender.
Extremities:  A right above the knee amputation with
prosthesis.  Left leg with chronic venostasis changes.
Rectal:  Good tone.  Contaminated by external blood.
Neurological:  No focal deficits.

LABORATORY DATA UPON ADMISSION:  Chemistries generally normal
with creatinine of 1.2.  Blood gas 7.39/49/341/31/4, lactate
2.5, amylase 107, fibrinogen 171.  PT 15.8, PTT 36.1, INR
1.7.  His white blood count was 5.1, hematocrit 34.4.  Urine
toxicology was not performed.

A chest x-ray was within normal limits, status post left
subclavian line placement which was in place.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the Operating Room
for wound exploration directly from the Trauma Room.  The
patient was taken to the Operating Room, as mentioned above,
for an exploratory laparotomy, extensive lysis of adhesions,
and control of rectus and omental bleeding.  The estimated
blood loss was approximately 1,000 cc.  Please see the
operative note dictated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2199-2-8**] for
complete report.

The patient was then transferred to the SICU where his
coagulopathy was corrected.  He received 4 units of packed
red cells, 4 units of FFP, and 1 cryoprecipitate.

While on the unit, he was extubated on [**2199-2-10**], SICU
day number three and he was noted to have progressive
thrombocytopenia.  His home p.o. medications were restarted
as well.

On [**2199-2-11**], hospital day number four, the patient
was transferred to the floor.  His diet was advanced and he
was placed on an aggressive bowel regimen to get his bowels
moving postsurgically.  The Pain Service was also consulted
because of the patient's history of narcotic abuse and his
continued complaints of pain.  They recommended increasing
his dose of Klonopin and starting MSIR.

On hospital day number five, the patient was noted to have a
heparin-induced antibody which may be one of the reasons he
was coagulopathic on admission, although his HIV disease and
other drug abuse cannot be ruled out as cause.  His platelet
count remained relatively stable, however, as did his
hematocrit.

By hospital day number six, the patient was doing somewhat
better; however, after being noted to be somewhat sedated,
his Klonopin dose as well as MSIR and methadone were
decreased.  The patient did work with Physical Therapy and
was able to ambulate, hop a bit out of bed.

Additionally, Case Management spoke with the patient's
long-term nurse practitioner, who stated that at baseline he
normally uses a wheelchair and occasionally walks on his
prosthesis.  Additionally, the nurse practitioner stated that
the patient does chronically abuse drugs, both prescriptions
and illicits, and advised not to give the patient any pain
prescriptions upon discharge as he had more than enough at
home.  It was also discussed that the patient would often try
to prolong his hospital courses in the past in an attempt to
get more narcotics.

On the date of discharge, the patient will be set up with VNA
Services for home to change his dressings.  He will also be
instructed to follow-up with his primary care doctor or
Trauma Clinic to have the staples removed from his abdominal
wound.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharged to home with services.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Same as on admission.

FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  As mentioned above, with the Trauma Clinic
and his primary care doctor.

.
ECHO ([**2203-11-3**]) Pre-pericardiocentesis: The left atrium is
elongated. The estimated right atrial pressure is >20 mmHg. The
left ventricular cavity is unusually small. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The right ventricular cavity
is moderately dilated. There is a large circumferential
pericardial effusion. Stranding is visualized within the
pericardial space c/w some organization. There is left atrial
diastolic collapse. There is right ventricular diastolic
collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade
physiology. There is significant, accentuated respiratory
variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, consistent with
impaired ventricular filling.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2203-10-20**],
large pericardial effusion with echocardiographic signs of
tamponade is new.
.
ECHO ([**2203-11-3**]) Post pericardiocentesis: The left atrium is
elongated. The right atrium is markedly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and systolic function (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity
is markedly dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is
normal. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely
more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is partial flail of a tricuspid valve leaflet. The tricuspid
valve leaflets fail to fully coapt. Severe [4+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2203-11-3**],
the residue pericardial effusion is minimal.
.
Cardiac catherization ([**2203-11-3**]):
1. Large circumferential pericardial effusion with tamponade
physiology.
2. Successful pericardiocentesis with drainage of 1500mls of
blood
stained fluid. Patient left cathlab in stable condition
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe pericardial tamponade.
2. Mild primary pulmonary hypertension.
3. Successful pericardiocentesis with drainage of 1500ml of
blood
stained fluid.
.
ECHO ([**2203-11-4**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right
atrium is markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Transmitral and
tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a
normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The
right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Right
ventricular systolic function is borderline normal [intrinsic
function is likely depressed given the severity of tricuspid
regurgitation.]. There is abnormal diastolic septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume
overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened and appear shortened/remnants that do not fully
coapt. A small echodensity is seen on the right atrial side of
the septal leaflet - ?vegetation ?old vs. partial flail of
leaflet segment. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is a small (<1cm), circumferential, partially echo filled
pericardial effusion without evidence of hemodynamic compromise.

Compared with the prior study (post-pericardiocentesis, images
reviewed) of [**2203-11-3**], the findings are similar.
.
ECHO ([**2203-11-5**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic
function (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is borderline
normal. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened and appear shortened/remnants and fail to fully
coapt. A small echodensity is again seen on the right atrial
side of the septal leaflet which could be either a vegeateion or
a partial leaflet segment. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation
is seen. There is a small pericardial effusion. The effusion is
echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other
cellular elements. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2203-11-4**],
the pericardial effusion is slightly smaller and may be more
echo dense. The left ventricular cavity size is probably
slightly larger (reflecting better filling). The small
echodensity on the tricuspid leaflet has not changed in size.
.
ECHO ([**2203-11-8**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right
atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The
right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic
function is normal. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic
function is likely more depressed given the severity of
tricuspid regurgitation.] There is abnormal septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets fail to fully coapt.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2203-11-5**],
pericardial effusion now appears slightly smaller.
.
ECHO ([**2203-11-11**]):
The right atrium is markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
systolic function (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is
borderline normal. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The
tricuspid valve leaflets fail to fully coapt. There is a very
small, partially echo filled pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2203-11-8**],
the findings are similar.


Brief Hospital Course:
41 year old male with HIV/AIDS, previous R-sided endocarditis
and severe TR, presented in cardiac tamponade from
rehabilitation.

CARDIAC TAMPONADE:  On admission, he was transferred to the
cardiac catherization lab, where over one liter of fluid was
drained from his pericardial space.  The fluid was sent for gram
stain, culture, AFB, [**Doctor First Name **], TB PCR as well as viral studies and
cytology.  A pericardial drain was initially left in place, but
given minimal drainage over 24 hours, was pulled prior to his
transfer to the floor.  The etiology of the pericardial effusion
is unknown.  He was followed by Cardiology on the floor and the
initial plan was for a pericardial window, for both tissue and
to prevent reaccumulation of fluid.  The patient refused the
procedure at this time.  He will follow up as an outpatient to
re-evaluate for the procedure.  The effusion was followed by
serial ECHO while the patient was in the hospital.  There was no
evidence of re-accumulation.  He is scheduled for an outpatient
ECHO in several weeks to evaluate the pericardial space for
reaccumlation of effusion.

ATRIAL FIBRILLATION/FLUTTER: Per multiple EKGs, the patient
appears to have developed new a fib/flutter.  Given his guaiac
positive stools, it is not advisable to start anticoagulation at
this time.  The patient is being rate controlled on a low dose
of beta-blocker, which appears to be effective.  He will be
followed by outpatient Cardiology.

ANEMIA: The patient had a hematocrit drop during this admission.
 His lab studies are consistent with anemia of chronic disease,
however, the patient was found to have guaiac positive stools.
GI was consulted and recommeded colonoscopy and EGD.  The
patient was unable to tolerate the prep and thus the colonoscopy
was cancelled.  His EGD demonstrated gastritis and thrush.  He
was started on fluconazole to treat the thrush.  He was also
transfused two units of packed red blood cells with an
appropriate hematocrit response.

HIV/AIDS:  The patient had a CD4 count checked during his last
admission, it was found to be 132 with a viral load >100K.
Given his past noncompliance with HAART therapy and the risk of
developing drug resistant HIV,  HAART was not restarted.  Pt is
willing to restart HARRT, and the plan remains to restart
medications at rehabilitation.  Bactrim was continued for PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].

OSTEOMYELITIS:  The patient was previously admitted for left
ankle pain.  He was followed previously by both the orthopedic
and ID services.  Both services continued to follow the patient
on this admission.  The patient was continued on 6 weeks of IV
antibiotics (last day of cefazolin [**2203-12-5**]), although the dose
was decreased to 1g q6 because of a low white blood count.

SEVERE TRICUSPID REGURGITATION: Pt with known grade 4 TR and
flail leaflet which he deveoped after acute bacterial
endocarditis roughly 10 years ago.  We restarted his lasix and
spironolactone on this admission.

HCV: HCV viral load checked, and found to be 1.5 million.  No
further therapy initiated.

ANXIETY: Pt with history of anxiety and on Klonapin at home.
His home regimen was continued.

ESOPHAGEAL CANDIDIASIS: Patient was found to have thrush on EGD.
 He was started on a course of fluconazole given his
immunosupressed state.  He is being discharged to complete a two
week course of anti-fungal medication.

Service:  MEDICINE ONCOLOGY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 81-year-old female
with a history of metastatic melanoma with known metastases
to the liver and lung who status post resection in the 90s
with recurrence in [**2146**] status post treatment with Taxol.

She presented to the Emergency Room on [**2152-10-3**],
with altered mental status, decreased p.o. intake, confusion
and headache over several weeks, and was found to have three
mass lesions in her brain on head CT.

The patient was started on Decadron, as well as Dilantin.  In
the Emergency Room she became hypertensive and was sent to
the SICU.  She was maintained on Nipride GTT.

In the Intensive Care Unit, the patient was weaned off
Nipride and then changed to Labetalol, Hydralazine. The patient
was also noted to have cellulitis on her left knee and was
initially maintained on Vancomycin and later changed to Keflex.

The patient was also evaluated by Radiation/Oncology, and it
was decided that the patient would received a total of seven
treatments of whole brain radiation therapy in conjunction
with Decadron, as well as Dilantin.

During her Intensive Care Unit stay, the patient had
increased alertness and was more oriented, although she does
have a history of baseline dementia.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Metastatic melanoma status post
resection in [**2138**] with recurrence in [**2146**] status post
treatment with Taxol.  History of paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation with anticoagulation in the past.  Status post
PCM for sinoatrial dysfunction.  History of coronary artery
disease status post myocardial infarction in [**2143**].  MIBI in
[**2152-6-23**] showed an ejection fraction of 50%.  History of
hypercholesterolemia.  History of hypertension,
osteoarthritis, cellulitis.  Status post skin graft.  Peptic
ulcer disease.  History of bladder cancer.  Chronic renal
insufficiency.

ALLERGIES:  AMOXICILLIN, OXACILLIN AND PERCOCET, REACTIONS
UNKNOWN.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Imdur 30 mg, Warfarin, Lasix 20
q.d., Calcium Carbonate 1500 q.d., Vitamin D 4000 q.d.,
Colace 100 mg b.i.d., Protonix 40 q.d., Dietrol 2 mg b.i.d.,
Labetalol 300 mg b.i.d., Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a home health aide.  Husband
died three months ago.  She walks but recently was unable to
do so.  She otherwise has a very close family.

FAMILY HISTORY:  On maternal side there is a history of
diabetes, as well as hypertension.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 96.5??????, blood
pressure 161/47, pulse 74, respirations 14, oxygen saturation
98% on 2 L, 92% on room air.  General:  She was elderly,
lying in bed.  She was sometimes agitated and not following
commands.  She was nonverbal.  HEENT:  Normocephalic,
atraumatic.  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.
Extraocular movements intact.  Dry mucous membranes.  There
was poor dentition.  Neck:  Supple.  No lymphadenopathy.
Heart:  Regular, rate and rhythm.  There was an early
systolic ejection murmur, 3 out of 6.  Lungs:  Clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Good bowel sounds.  Extremities:  There were
bilateral skin eschars.  The left knee had excoriation and
was erythematous.  Neurological:  The patient was obtunded
and not following commands.  She had a limited neurologic
exam.  Cranial nerves II, III and IV intact.  She was moving
both hands with appropriate strength.  No lifting of left arm
off bed.  Right lower extremity with decreased strength,
apparently chronic secondary to polio.  On the left lower
extremity, she moved toes and feet.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission her white count was 6.4,
hematocrit 37.5, platelet count 269, neutrophils 73, 22
lymphs, 3 monos; INR 1.1, PT 12.7, PTT 27.8; sodium 138,
potassium 4.3, chloride 106, bicarb 22, BUN 36, creatinine
1.8, baseline 1.4-1.5; platelet count 151; calcium 10.6,
magnesium 1.9, phos 3.1, CK 116, MB 5, troponin 0.04; Albumin
4.2; TSH 2.9; urinalysis with occasional bacteria, trace
ketones, 30 protein.

Electrocardiogram was paced, lateral T-wave inversion,
inferior T-wave inversion which new consistent with [**2152-6-23**].

Head CT showed three moderately large-sized mass lesions in
the right posterior frontal, right anterior frontal lobe and
left parietal lesion with significant edema.  There was a
small amount of peripheral density, question of hemorrhage or
calcification.

Chest x-ray revealed cardiomegaly, atelectasis, but no overt
failure.

Knee films showed no fracture and no dislocation and
degenerative changes with small right knee effusion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Altered mental status:  This was felt
to be secondary to metastatic disease to the brain.  The
patient was evaluated by Radiation/Oncology, and it was
decided that the patient would receive a total of seven
treatments of whole-brain radiation therapy.

Additionally she was maintained on Decadron, as well as
Dilantin.  The patient had no seizure activity while in the
hospital.  She tolerated her Decadron well and tolerated her
whole-brain radiation therapy without any complications.

The patient was discharged on a Decadron taper.  Her Dilantin
dose was increased to a total of 300 three times a day, given
that her Dilantin level [**Company 2240**].i.d. was only 8.  The
patient will need her Dilantin level followed as an
outpatient at her next appointment.

2.  Hypertension:  The patient's blood pressures while in the
Emergency Room were noted to be 200/100; however, once she
was transferred to the floor, she maintained very good
control on a combination of Clonidine, Hydrochlorothiazide
and Minoxidil, Hydralazine, as well as Labetalol 400 b.i.d.
The patient's blood pressures were maintained in the 140s to
160s systolic, and it was decided that this was an
appropriate range given that the patient needed to have
adequate perfusion in the face of increased
intracranial pressure.

3.  Cellulitis:  The patient was initially maintained on
Vancomycin, and this was later changed to Keflex.  The
patient did not develop any rash or other complications
Keflex.  Her cellulitis was improved by the time of
discharge.

4.  Renal insufficiency:  Her creatinine remained at baseline
between 1.4-1.5.

5.  Coronary artery disease:  The patient was maintained on
enteric coated Aspirin, as well as Labetalol.  The patient
ruled out for myocardial infarction, and her
electrocardiogram remained stable without any EKG changes.

6.  FEN:  The patient was maintained on a soft diet, as well
as thin liquids.  She tolerated this without event.
Additionally her electrolytes were followed daily and were
repleted as needed.  Her I&Os were monitored closely.

7.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation:  The patient is paced.
She was rate controlled.  She was held off all
anticoagulation given her metastatic disease to the brain.

DISPOSITION:  The patient was discharged to her home because
her family wanted the patient to do so.  The patient has [**12-27**]
full-time nurses that will be following her once she is
discharged to home.  Her mental status improved greatly while
the patient was in the hospital.  By the time of discharge,
the patient was conversive and much more alert and oriented.

Her neurologic exam was significant for intact cranial nerves
and the ability to move all extremities spontaneously.  She
did have limited movement in her arms, given that she has a
history of bursitis.  Otherwise, the patient's exam
neurologically was much improved.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.  She was stable on room air.
She could not ambulate without assistance and does need help
with all bed transfers.  She was tolerating a p.o. diet
without problems.  [**Name (NI) **] mental status had improved
considerably in that she was conversant, could move her
extremities spontaneously, and cranial nerves were intact.
Her strength was notable for weakness throughout but was
symmetric.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Metastatic melanoma with metastases to the liver, lung
and brain.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
5.  Osteoarthritis.
6.  Bursitis.
7.  Cellulitis.
8.  Chronic renal insufficiency.
9.  Coronary artery disease.
10. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  As stated above, the patient will be
discharged to home with [**Hospital 2241**] nursing care.  Home Hospice
has been discussed with the family, and they would like to
avail this possibility as the need arises.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 2251**] is a 70yoF with h/o dilated cardiomyopathy [**1-1**]
aortic outflow obstruction, AICD s/p VT, CAD, COPD (on home O2)
who presented with decreased UO and SOB, now transferred from
medicine service to CCU for hypotension. Pt is currently
somnolent and unable to provide a detailed history, so details
are obtained from OMR and Atrius records.  Pt saw NP in complex
care clinic on [**7-10**], at that time felt well overall, c/o dry
cough but denied SOB, peripheral edema. At that time her weight
was recorded at 185 lbs (dry weight is estimated at 184 lbs). On
[**7-17**] she called the CCC office c/o minimal urine output (""only
drops"") and cough productive of yellow sputum.  She reported
compliance with her home diuretic regimen, but [**Name8 (MD) **] NP note she
had not filled her aldactone rx.
.
On DOA, she called EMS due to increasing SOB.  When EMS arrived
her SBP was 80.  She received 250cc NS and was brought to ED.
In ED she had SBP 90s so received another 500cc NS bolus. CXR
showed no e/o infiltrate but she was treated empirically for CAP
with 1g ceftriaxone given her recent productive cough. Labs were
significant for Na 121 and Cr 5.4 (baseline 3.5-4.0). She was
admitted to medicine service.  On the floor, her BP was
initially 98/65 but then decreased to SBP 70s.  She was
transferred to CCU for pressor support.
.
On transfer, vitals were T 95.7, HR 60 (v-paced), BP 110/56, RR
18, O2sat 100% on 2LNC.  She was drowsy, but denied current SOB,
chest pain, palpitations, LE swelling.  She endorsed orthopnea
(c/w baseline) cough productive of yellow sputum, nausea, RUQ
discomfort, and anuria. Denied recent fevers/chills,
diarrhea/constipation, melena/hematochezia, BRBPR.
.
Of note she was admitted 1 month ago (from [**Date range (1) 2266**]) for CHF
exacerbation and hypervolemia. She was started on a lasix drip
with metolazone but was ultimately started on ultrafiltration
with a tunneled HD line which she tolerated well. She has not
required outpatient HD since discharge.

atrium is markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 %) with regional
variation, the apical segments more hypokinetic than the basal
segments. The right ventricular free wall thickness is normal.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with borderline normal
free wall function. There are focal calcifications in the aortic
arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-1**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The main
pulmonary artery is dilated. The branch pulmonary arteries are
dilated. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CXR [**2194-7-18**]: There is a left-sided pacemaker/ICD with right
atrial and right ventricular leads, as before. Severe
cardiomegaly is not significantly changed. Pulmonary venous
congestion is seen without definite interstitial pulmonary
edema. No focal consolidations are seen. There are no pleural
effusions. No pneumothorax is seen. There is minimal right
basilar atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Primary Reason for Admission
70yoF with h/o dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 35%), AICD p/w SOB and
poor urine output for several days found to have hyponatremia,
now transferred from medicine to CCU due to hypotension.
.
Active Issues:
.
#Acute on chronic systolic heart failure:  The patient was
hypervolemic on exam with elevated JVP and increased abdominal
distension at presentation.  Given the patient had been
refractory to diuretic therapy requiring ultrafiltration during
her last hospitalization and was oliguric and hyponatremic on
admission, ultrafiltration was initiated rather than diuretic
therapy. She experienced significant muscle cramping and
hypotension while on CVVHD requiring dopamine. CVVHD was
discontinued on HD#2 and she was diuresed with IV lasix and
metolazone. Pressures improved and she was weaned off of
dopamine.  It was noted that urine and blood pressure improved
when the patient was in her native sinus rhythm with
asynchronous ventricular pacing.  Therefore the patients
pacemaker escape rate was lowered to allow for increased native
rhythm and the mode was changed to AAIR.  Despite this change
urine output remained poor and she was therefore started on a
lasix drip ultimately requiring milrinone to augment diuresis.
On HD#6 patient underwent placement of a tunneled dialysis
catheter, and on HD#7 she continued HD using the tunneled line
(see below). Lasix and metolazone were discontinued as patient
will be HD dependent.
.
#Hypotension:  Patient was hypotensive on admission in the
setting of volume overload.  Her hypotension was believed to be
due to worsening cardiac output in setting of dilated
cardiomyopathy. She was temporarily on a dopamine gtt, but this
was weaned by HD#2.  In addition, she experienced episodes of
hypotension with CVVH with diuresis and antihypertensive
medications, so her antihypertensive medications were held. On
discharge, her BP was stable.  She was asked to continue to hold
her carvedilol and to follow up with her PCP about restarting as
tolerated.
.
# Hyponatremia: Pts sodium was 119 on admission and likely cause
of her AMS, thought to be hypervolemic hyponatremia with poor
renal perfusion given e/o volume overload on exam and low urine
Na. Her fluid intake was restricted to 1.5L daily, and she
started CVVH as above with improvement in her hyponatremia as
well as her mental status.  At the time of discharge her sodium
was 135.
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Patient was noted to have a
creat of 5.4, baseline 3.5-4.0, and oliguria x 2-3 days on
admission. As stated above she had previously required
ultrafiltration during hospitalizations for heart failure
exacerbation.  Renal was consulted and felt that the patient
would require chronic HD.  Given her hypotension she was
initally started on CVVH with dopamine gtt for pressure support.
 However as above she did not tolerate CVVH and it was
discontinued.  She was diuresed with lasix gtt and milrinone as
above until she had her tunneled line placed on HD#6.  She
tolerated HD well, with stable BP and no muscle cramping.
Outpatient dialysis was arranged with [**Location (un) **] [**Location (un) **] Dialysis
Center for mondays, wednesdays and fridays.
.
# Afib: Pt has a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin at
home.  On admission her coumadin was held in preparation for
placement of a tunneled dialysis catheter. As stated above her
pacemaker settings were changed and she was in sinus rhythm for
most of her CCU course with heart rates in the 50-70s.  Her mode
was changed to AAIR to allow for intrinsice AV conduction and
minimize ventricular pacing in an abnormal heart. Her coumadin
was restarted at her home dose on HD#7.  Her INR at the time of
discharge was 1.4.

# Stable issues:
.
# COPD: Patient's recent cough and SOB with h/o COPD was
initially c/f COPD exacerbation, and she was initially started
on prednisone and levofloxacin. However there was no wheezing on
exam therefore prednisone and antibiotics were discontinued. She
was continued on her home albuterol/ipratropium nebulizer
treatments, and maintained O2 sats >90% on 2L NC (her baseline
O2 requirement).
.
# CAD: Stable, no c/o chest pain during hospitalization.  She
was continued on her home ASA and pravastatin.
.
# HTN: Carvedilol was discontinued due to frequent episodes of
hypotension (with SBP 70s-80s).  She can resume as an outpatient
if BP tolerates.
.
# Gout: Patient was continued on her home allopurinol and did
not have any pain concerning for a gout flare.
.
# Transitional issues:
- Patient maintained full code status throughout
hospitalization.
- She will continue outpatient hemodialysis at [**Location (un) **] [**Location (un) **]

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure taking care of you while you were in the
hospital.

You were admitted to the hospital for shortness of breath and
not making urine. Your heart was not pumping well which caused
you to have extra fluid.  We gave you medication to help you to
urinate out this fluid however your kidneys were not working
properly and you needed dialysis to do the job of your kidneys.
You got a special IV to be used for dialysis. You will need to
continue going to dialysis three times a week. Your blood
pressure was also so low so we did not give you your home blood
pressure medications while you were in the hospital.

You should continue to go to dialysis three times a week.  You
were also started on a medication called nephrocaps that you
will need to continue.

You should stop taking your carvedilol, metolazone,
spironolactone and lasix unless your doctor instructs you to
restart these medications.

Continue your coumadin and amiodarone for your abnormal heart
rhythm (atrial fibrillation).  Continue your aspirin and
pravastatin for your heart disease, your allopurinol for your
gout, your albuterol and ipratropium for your COPD.

Brief Hospital Course:
71F with history of CHF, CAD, afib on coumadin, ESRD on HD and
COPD presenting with LLE cellulitis.
.
# Cellulitis - patient with chronic ulcers on left lower
extremity presented with inreased pain and erythema and elevated
WBC consistent with cellulitis.  She was recently treated for
cellulitis in that leg with vancomycin on previous
hospitalization in [**2194-1-28**]. After two days of vancomycin, she
had marked improvement in the leg with decreased erythema in
color and was dramatically receeding from the marked border
below the area. There was still [**12-1**]+pitting edema in the left
thigh, but improved compared to admission when it was harder and
was obscuring the anatomical markings of the knee on extension.
LENI of the leg was negative for DVT.  She was seen by vascular
surgery during this admission, who did not feel that surgery was
indicated and agreed with the proposed medical management.
-Vancomycin dosed with HD x 2 weeks (last day [**4-28**])
-Ciprofloxacin 500mg po qday x 2 weeks (last day [**4-28**])
.
#Hypotension - patient hypotensive to SBPs in 80s. In the ED
there was concern that she was possibly septic, so she was
admited to the ICU. She received 1.5L of IV fluids and her BP
repsonded well. Her baseline blood pressure is in the low 90s
systolic.  After being on the floor she continued to have lower
blood pressures and was asymptomatic with them.
-She will require monitoring of her blood pressure during
[**Month/Year (2) 2286**] sessions
.
# Afib - on amiodarone and coumadin as outpatient.  Stable.  INR
therapeutic at 2.1 on admission.  Continued on home medications
- cont warfarin and amiodarone
.
# CAD - Continued on amiodarone, pravastatin and SLNGT
.
# COPD - on spiriva, alubterol and fluticasone at home. Also
uses 2L NC at night at home. Has had cough for the past [**3-6**]
weeks and recently started on doxycycline on [**4-10**], which was
continued for planned 7 day course total and will be completed
on [**4-16**].  No worsening SOB.  CXR showed no evidence of PNA
.
# chronic sytolic CHF - Continued on home furosemide dose.
Patinet is not on ACEI prior to this admission, and this was not
started given her hypotension.
.
# ESRD - Continued on HD schedule of T-TH-SAT. She received an
extra ultrafiltration session on [**4-17**] (friday) to try to remove
more fluid from her left leg.

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2130-2-3**] Mr. [**Known lastname 2302**] was admitted to the surgery service
under the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with the diagnosis of a lower GI
bleed. His initial Hct was 28 and initial INR was 15. He was
admitted to the ICU and resuscitated. He was transfused 2 units
of PRBCs for a Hct of 22, and 2 units of FFP to reverse his
anticoagulation. He was also given Vitamin K. The following day
he was transfused 4 more units of PRBCs. The GI service was
consulted and 2 attempts were made to do a colonoscopy. Both
attempts were aborted due to a poor preparation. After 3 days in
the ICU, Mr. [**Known lastname 2303**] Hct was stable at 26-27. He was
transferred to the floor and given 1 more unit of PRBCs for
borderline urine output. His Hct then stabilized at 28-29. Since
he had no more episodes of bloody bowel movements, it was felt
that there was no need to make further attempts at colonoscopy.
His diet was then slowly advanced, physical therapy evaluated
the patient, and he was discharged to rehab on HD 7. He will
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1940**] from GI as well as his PCP regarding
his coumadin dose and INR checks. At the time of discharge he
was placed on coumadin 1mg Qhs (h/o PE and cardiac thrombus) and
his INR was 1.4. His Hct was 28.7.

his stool occasionally.  Three days prior to admission, pt had
an INR of 2.7 at coumadin clinic.  One day prior to presenation,
the patient self-started asacol from previous prescription
because worsening of rectal chrone's disease.  On day of
presentation, pt began having dark red bloody BMs, had ~15
episodes before calling EMS.  Upon ED arrival, had several
additional large bloody BMs.  He received vitamin K SQ, 2 FFP,

the previous
tracing of [**2130-2-3**] the QRS width is wider and R wave reversal in
the lateral
precordial leads is more marked, related to axis or lateral
myocardial
infarction. Clinical correlation is suggested.


Brief Hospital Course:
## Hematochezia/Crohn's: Likely [**1-12**] combination of known Crohn's
and overanticoagulation most likely due to drug interaction of
coumadin w/ sasacol. Received 2Units FFP and 1 unit PRBC + vit
K. With drop of Hct as low as 23.6, 27.0 upon d/c.  INR upon d/c
1.0.  Underwent colonoscopy showing ulcer in proximal ascending
colon which wx bx to exclude ulcerated neoplasia, chrohn's dz
which was bx, and pseudopolyps in the descending colon and
sigmoid colon.
.
## ARF: likely hypovolemia in setting of GIB, Cr of 1.6 from
baseline of 1.0. Currently back to baseline.
.
## Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: in sinus rhythm on [**Month/Day (2) 2304**].
- hold anticoag for now as risks outweigh benefits.  Will be
restarted w/ f/u w/ PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] control meds because of bleeding,
pt not in AF on [**Last Name (LF) 2304**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] restart BB w/ d/c to rehab facility.


## HTN: Meds held in setting of bleed, restarting OP meds w/ d/c
to rehab.  Holding lasix [**1-12**] to continued dehydration [**1-12**] to
poor PO intake.
.
## DCM: appears euvolemic
- hold furosemide in setting of GI bleed
.
## h/o PE, LV thrombus:
- hold anticoag in setting of GI bleed, will restart as
outpatient.

Discharge Diagnosis:
Lower GI Bleed


Discharge Condition:
Stable


Discharge Instructions:
  You are being discharged from the hospital after an admission
for a lower gastrointestinal bleed.  Because of significant
blood loss, you were stabilized throughout the admission with
transfusion of blood products and clotting proteins.  You
underwent colonoscopy to evaluate for source of the bleeding.
It not only showed multiple areas of sick colon consistent with
your Chron's disease, but also a non-bleeding ulcer in the
bowel.  Multiple biopsy's were taken, results pending.  The most
likely cause of your bleeding is your very low ability to clot
due to a reaction between your blood thinner coumadin and the
asacol which you started.  Both medications are being stopped,
and only restarted after discussion between your PCP and your
Gastroenterologist.
   After being evaluated by Physical Therapy, it is felt that
you would benefit from a short stay in an acute rehab facility
to help improve your strength after this hospitalization.

Followup Instructions:
Follow up w/ Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 216**] in [**12-12**] weeks ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 1300**]
Follow up w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2305**] in [**12-12**] weeks ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2306**]

[**2131-7-10**]: ECHO
LA is normal in size. No ASD is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric LV hypertrophy. LV cavity is moderately
dilated. There is a sessile mural thrombus at the LV apex; the
clot is mural and not mobile. Overall LV systolic function is
moderately-to-severely depressed (LVEF= 30 %) secondary to
severe hypokinesis of the inferior, posterior, and lateral
walls, and extensive apical akinesis. There is no VSD. RV
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. AV leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but AS is not
present. Mild (1+) AR is seen. MV leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no MVP. Mild (1+) MR is seen. LV inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. The estimated PA systolic pressure
is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior report (images
unavailable for review) of [**2130-2-3**], a LV apical
thrombus is now present

[**2131-7-9**] Stress Test:
IMPRESSION: No significant ST-T wave changes in the setting of
baseline
ST-T wave abnormalities. No anginal-type symptoms. Nuclear
report sent
separately.

[**2131-7-9**] PMIBI:
IMPRESSION: 1. Abnormal study. 2. Severe, fixed perfusion defect
involving the inferior wall and the a large region at the apex.
3. Moderately dilated LV. 4. Akinetic apex and inferior wall
with LVEF 28%.

[**2131-7-9**] MRI Abdomen
IMPRESSION:
1. Hypodense flat subcapsular lesion within segment IV-B on
prior CT from [**2131-7-6**], demonstrates a slight delayed
enhancement; however gross stability since [**2129-4-9**] CT abdomen
and pelvis suggest a benign lesion. This lesion is amenable to
further evaluation by targeted ultrasound, possibly with biopsy,
as clinically indicated.
2. Vague 1.3 cm lesion in segment 7 on prior CT from [**2131-7-6**]
is not clearly visualized. However, this examination is motion
limited and a small lesion within this vicinity cannot entirely
be excluded.
3. Filling defect in the lower common bile duct suggests
choledocholithiasis without evidence of acute obstruction.

[**2131-7-6**] CT chest/abd/pelvis w/ w/o contrast
1) 3.7 cm irregular soft tissue mass at the lateral aspect of
the ascending colon, associated with lymph nodes, corresponding
to the colon cancer seen on colonoscopy. Small amount of fluid
along the right paracolic gutter, probably due to biopsy. 2)
Featureless appearance of the descending and sigmoid colon, with
increased wall thickening and fat stranding in the descending
colon, suggestive of active inflammation due to Crohn's disease.

3) Ill-defined 1.3 cm lesion in the segment 7 of the liver, for
which metastasis is suspected given the colon cancer. Further
evaluation by multiphasic MRI is recommended.
4) Unchanged nodular appearance of the left adrenal gland. The
finding can be evaluated at the time of MRI as well.
6) New bilateral pleural effusion.
7) Increased mucosal enhancement in the perianal region, with
probable perianal fistula on the right, new since prior study.
8) Multiple hypodense lesions in the kidney, unchanged since
prior study.

Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
57 yo F with PMHX of HTN who presents with shortness of breath x
7 days, worsening over the last 3 days. Patient reports that she
has been feeling weak over the last 3 weeks with an
unintentional 10 lb weight loss (of note over the last 2 months
she has lost 20lbs).  1 week ago she started feeling SOB with
exertion, and ""hot and cold"" but no fevers chills.  Then 3 days
ago she began to have a non-productive cough that left her
""gasping for air"", worse at night, with ""belly racing"", (which
appears to be belly breathing when pt demonstrates this).
Patient denies nausea, vomiting, chest pain, night sweats, but
does endorse a poor appetite. She reports that food has been
tasting bland over the last week and that she will only eat food
that's ""really tasty"" like [**Location (un) 86**] Market, but most of the time
she just has soup at home.  Of note, patient also reports that 2
weeks ago she had burning on urination for 7 days that went away
spontaneously.  She also reports that over the last 3 days she
has been having more watery stools than normal, but no more
frequent BM's than usual.  Patient attributed the loose stools
to her being ill ""it's what happens when I get sick.""
Today was seen by NP[**Company 2316**], found to have decreased breath
sounds throughout, HR of 120, O2 sat of 70%, increased to 84% on
2L, so was sent to the ED.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 110 120/80 28 86% 6L (to 100% on
NRB). On exam, shallow breathing and tachypneic but mild degree
of respiratory distress. Flu swab ordered. EKG showed ***. CXR
showed atypical pneumonia vs PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 227**] [**Name11 (NameIs) 2317**], ordered for
azithromycin, but unclear if given. Got 1 liter IVF on way out
of ED. Access is 18g and 20g PIV. Temp 97.6 96 120/70 37 99,NRB.
.
On the floor, patient reported feeling ""much better"", and when
asked what had caused her improvement she reported that it was
""the oxygen, definitely"".

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2190-2-11**] 10:44 AM
IMPRESSION: Diffuse hazy opacities within both lungs, without
evidence for volume overload. Findings are most concerning for a
diffuse infectious process, likely with atypical organisms. If
the patient is immunocompromised, PCP should be considered.


Brief Hospital Course:
On admission there was high index of suspicion for PCP given the
appearance on chest x-ray and a significant amount of
oropharyngeal thrush. Bronchoscopy with BAL on [**2190-2-12**] was
positive for PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was presumptively started on Bactrim and
Prednisone treatment in the emergency department. She was
consented for HIV testing and it came back positive with a
viral load (VL) of 114,000 and a CD4 of 8. Her oxygenation was
tenuous initially requiring face mask with desaturation to the
high 70 with movement to the commode but she did not require
intubation. Over the course of her treatment she was transition
ed to face tent and eventually to 4-5 L of oxygen via nasal
cannula. Her overall oxygenation minimally improved very slowly
despite Bactrim with a prolonged steroid taper. She was finally
discharged home with O2 supplementation of [**3-2**] L to keep O2 sat
at 94 % at rest. Her hypoxia was related to the PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**].
For confirmation, she underwent CTA of the lung which was
negative for pulmonary embolism. The CT did show diffuse ground
glass opacities as well as lymphadenopathy without effusions
consistent with the diagnosis of PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 2321**] her exertional
hypoxia, she remained well with minimal symptoms (only mild
dyspnea with activity but no significant cough and no fever or
chest pain). Patient remained in the hospital for several extra
days hoping that her hypoxia will improve. It did remain stable
at the above level without any additional symptoms (4-5 L at
rest with O2 sat at 94 with decrease to 87-85 with activity.
Without oxygen, her O2 sat will decrease to 76 with activity).
In regards to the new diagnosis of AIDS(AIDS defining illness
and CD4 of 8), her toxoplasma IgG was positive. She was started
on azithromycin for [**Doctor First Name **] prophylaxis. ID was consulted and will
follow her closely as an outpatient ( 3 days after discharge).
HIV genotyping was sent and was pending at the time of
discharge. The patient has a history of hypertension and was
continued on home dose of Atenolol 50 mg daily.  BP was well
controlled despite holding amlodipine/chlorthalidone and these
were NOT restarted on discharge. She did have elevation of her
liver function tests on presentation. Work up included negative
hepatitis serologies and RUQ ultrasound (mild fatty
infiltration). LFTs abnormalities were related to PCP pneumonia,
fatty liver, or both. Blood AFB culture and HCV viral loads are
pending and will be followed by her ID. She was discharged home
without VNA, the latter would offer little help as she had no to
minimal symptoms. Total discharge time 56 minutes.

Scope ENT (on admission): Her glottic opening is about 4mm on
scope exam without symptoms including stridor or retraction.
.
CT neck with contrast ([**2105-4-16**]): Retropharyngeal fluid
collection spanning from C2/3 to C5/6 with extensive surrounding
edema and inflammation of the hypopharynx. The airway is
narrowed to 4mm at the level of the hyoid. Patent cervical
vasculature.
.
CXR ([**2105-4-17**]): As compared to the previous radiograph, there
is no relevant change. No pathologic mediastinal widening.
Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. Presence of minimal
pleural effusions cannot be excluded. No focal parenchymal
opacity suggesting pneumonia. No pulmonary edema.
.
CT neck and chest w/ contrast ([**2105-4-18**]):
1. Interval slight decrease of the retropharyngeal fluid
collection and
improved airway patency.
2. No evidence of Lemierre's disease or new abscess formation.

3. No evidence of extension of the fluid collection into the
mediastinum. No evidence of mediastinitis.
.
Chest CT ([**4-22**]): IMPRESSION:
1. Rapidly enlarging multiloculated right pleural effusion. This
could be due to empyema considering clinical suspicion for this
entity, but definitive diagnosis would require correlation with
thoracentesis results.
2. Small dependent left pleural effusion has also increased in
size since the prior study but does not have loculated
components.
3. Slight increase in size of pre- and sub-carinal lymph nodes
as well as right hilar nodes. These are likely reactive.
4. Ground-glass opacities in left upper lobe which are likely
infectious or inflammatory in etiology.
.
TTE ([**4-22**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is borderline
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
.
[**4-23**] CXR
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Evaluation of the patient with
complicated pleural
effusion.

Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison
to [**2105-4-21**].

There is interval increase in right pleural effusion, loculated,
better
appreciated on the prior radiograph but the change in size is
significant. No pneumothorax is seen. Left pleural effusion is
unchanged. Bibasal areas of atelectasis are noted.

Brief Hospital Course:
61 yo F with PMHX of HTN presenting with sore throat, neck pain,
and odynophagia found to have epiglottis and retrophargyneal
phlegmon.
.
#Epiglottis/retropharyngenal phlegmon: Diagnosed on CT neck and
by ENT scope. Symptoms consistent with this. The patient did
improve clinically with steroids, Ceftriaxone and clindamycin.
The patient's airway was closely monitored in the ICU and
underwent repeat ENT scoping on [**2105-4-18**] that showed ongoing
arytenoid edema but completely patent airway. Repeat CT neck and
chest with contrast, in the setting of ongoing posterior neck
pain and inspiration pain as well as worsening erythematous
lesion (see below), did not show Lemierre's or mediastinitis.
There was minimal interval improvement in the phlegmon
collection, however. Blood cultures from admission were positive
for GNRs, later grew out HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE. Planned for 14
day course from day of first negative culture. The patient
remained hemodynamically stable and re-evaluation by ENT in the
ICU showed improved of supraglottic swelling so she was
transfered to the floor. Repeat cultures were negative ???? HIV
was sent and was negative. Patient continued to be symptom free
on the floor and did not have any further airway complaints or
problems. She was treated symptomatically with cepacol lozenges
and was kept on a nicotine patch and received nebulizers PRN.
.
#Erythematous lesion: Patient developed a 3X3 inch erythematous
lesion on her anterior chest, 2 inches below cricoid and poorly
demarcated. The patient endorsed feeling warm and mildly tender
to palpation in this area with no pruritis. No
plaques/papules/bullae. The lesion was very blanching.
Dermatology was consulted on [**2105-4-18**] given spread of this
lesion to ~4X4 inches despite broadening to Vancomycin. Given
the timing of her antibiotics, this lesion was not felt due to
drug eruption, although a very early drug eruption can not be
ruled out. The erythema was felt most consistent with a toxic
exanthem, which is a vasodilation that occurs in patients with
bactermia (more often staph, strep). Supportive care was
provided. Derm followed patient while in house. by hospital day
4 the rash had significantly receeded. Derm did not feel
compelled to biopsy - they thought it was likely due to her
infectious process but did not represent a cellulitis. Her rash
improved later in her hospital course.
.
#Pneumonia and pleural effusion: She was noted to have
intermittent hypoxemia and R sided pleuritic chest pain on [**4-20**].
Medicine was consulted on [**4-22**], and in setting of new moderate
pleural effusions R>L on CXR, recommended chest CT, which showed
rapidly expanding and loculated effusion on R. She was then
transferred to medicine, and ID was consulted. Her antibiotics
were changed to ceftriaxone. Her pleural effusion was attempted
to be drained by IR, but they only withdrew 30 cc of fluid,
given loculation. Thoracic surgery was then involved and carried
out a VATS procedure which was uncomplicated and the patient was
transferred back to medicine.
.
#Hypertension: Blood pressures normal and intermittently high
(SBPs 150s) in-house. The patient's atenolol, lipitor were held
in the setting of epiglottis/retropharyngeal phlegmon but
restarted once she was able to tolerate POs. Atenolol was
initially started at half home dose 50mg, then back to her full
dose.However due to asymp. bradycardia into the 40's atenolol
was discontinued ad replaced with Chlorthalidone on [**4-25**].
.
# Intermittent bradycardia to 40s, asymptomatic: She was
monitored on telemetry with occasional intermittent bradycardia
to the 40s. her EKG was otherwise normal, without AVB. TTE was
done which showed no HD significant pericardial effusion,
abscess, or vegetations. Her bradycardia may have been due to
vagal tone in setting of pleural effusions and pleuritic pain.
.
# Lower extremity edema: She noted increased edema during this
admission. She had some baseline edema as a flight attendant but
only while standing for long durations. She had no JVD or HJR,
and TTE was normal.
.

was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] following a hospital course
for gallstone pancreatitis and now re-presents from rehab for
fevers.  During last admission, he was transferred from OSH with
with fever and pancreatitis which was thought to be from
gallstones although there were no gallstones in the bile ducts,
just in the gallbladder itself.  CT scan done on admissionw as
consistent with severe pancreatitis.  ERCP was done on [**2198-4-6**],
with sphinceterotomy and CBD stent placed.  His post procedure
course was complicated by fevers and repeat CT abd shows
progression of severe pancreatitis with extensive
peripancreatitis fluid collection.  This was thought to be

associated bilateral lower lobe atelectasis. Effusions slightly
larger than on [**2198-2-8**].

CXR:
Small bilateral pleural effusions have increased. Moderate
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is stable. Upper lungs
grossly clear. Atelectasis at the lung bases is slightly more
severe today. No pneumothorax. Transvenous right atrial pacer
and right ventricular pacer defibrillator leads are unchanged in
their respective positions. The patient is status post median
sternotomy and coronary bypass grafting.

Brief Hospital Course:
75 year old man with CAD s/p CABD and ischemic cardiomyopathy EF
25% who was recently admitted for gallstone pancreatitis, now
re-admitted from rehab for fevers.
.
# FEVERS: Likely source is from his pancreas.  On last
admission, he was febrile without an identified infectious
source and was thought to be from inflammatory response to
pancreatitis and peri-pancreatic fluid.  Currently with
leukocytosis and left shift although no localizing signs of
infection.  The differential at this time includes (infected)
pancreatic pseudocyst, necrotizing pancreatitis and an
obstructed bile duct stent.

================================================================
Surgery was then consulted and he went to the OR on [**4-24**] for his
Infected pancreatic necrosis, status post gallstone
pancreatitis. He had
1.  Exploratory laparotomy.
2.  Pancreatic debridement with wide drainage.
3.  Open cholecystectomy.
4.  Placement of a combined G/J tube (MIC tube).

Post-op he stayed in the ICU for 2 nights and was trasnfered to
the floor on POD 3.

GI/Abd: He was NPO with a NGT and IVF. The NGT was removed on
POD 2. His G-tube was left to gravity drainage.
His J-tube was capped and then trophic tubefeedings were started
on POD 2. His tubefeedings were advanced to a goal of Replete
with Fiber 3/4 strength at 80cc/hr.
He had 3 JP drains in place and these were draining thick, dark
fluid.
He continued to have high output from these drains.
He was started on sips on POD 5, he was advanced to clears on
POD 6.
JP amylase was checked on POD 7, once on a full liquid diet. His
JP Amylase was 27K, 34K, and 14K. He was made NPO due to his JP
amylase reported as high. He continued on the tubefeedings. A
grape juice test was positive for a leak from around the JP
drains.
He had one small spot with minimal drainage that could be
expressed from his incision.
His is now having drainage around all his drains and g/j tube
with mild skin irritation. He has irritation around the tube
extending out from ~0.5 - 3 cm and appears at [**Doctor First Name **] to develop
yeast. His midline incision is c/i but has a small amount of
serous drainage on the gauze.

Have suggested using Criticaid anti fungal moisture barrier to
protect his skin from the drainage and to prevent the formation
of yeast. Continue to apply a thin layer of dressing around the
drains and change as needed do not allow the gauze to become
saturated with drainage. Apply the antifungal Criticaid two to
three times/day.


A CT was obtained on [**5-5**] and showed:
1. Heterogeneity in the region of the pancreas consistent with
the patient's previous necrotizing pancreatitis.
2. Three surgical drains in situ with some high attenuation in
the region of the lesser sac which may represent fistulization
from the small bowel into this residual collection.
3. Loculated fluid under the anterior abdominal wall measuring
16 cm.
4. Gastrojejunostomy in situ.
5. Renal cysts.
6. Bilateral pleural effusions.
7. Enlarged prostate at 8 cm.
.
He will remain NPO with TF for 2 weeks and then return for a
repeat CT. His drains will remain and the drainage will be
monitored.

Pain: He had good pain control with a PCA. He continued on a PCA
thru POD 6. Once back on a diet, he was ordered for PO pain meds
with good control.

Labs: We monitored his labs and his Tbili decreased from a high
of 2.6 on POD 2 to WNL by [**2198-4-28**].

Cards: He was being followed by his PCP/Cardiologist. He was put
back on his home meds on POD5, including Lasix IV for gentle
diuresis and his heart meds.

Renal: He was diuresing well and continued to have negative
fluid balance and losing weight appropriately.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal Discomfort

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP x 2
Endotracheal Intubation

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 85 year old woman with PMH of ESRD on HD, HTN,
and DM, who presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED on [**7-21**] with complaint of
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea x 3 days. The
patient also reported recent fever and chills.  In  the ED,
patient had a low grade temperature of 100.5 degrees.  Her
abdomen was slightly distended, with no rigidity or rebound.
Admission laboratory data were notable for WBC 6.2, elevated
transaminases, and INR 3.7.  Right upper quadrant ultrasound
disclosed a 5 mm gallstone in the neck of the gallbladder.
There was also a 5mm  gallstone in the common bile duct, without
ductal dilatation.  The patient was evaluated by surgery for her
choledocholithiasis.  The patient was also seen by the ERCP
fellow.  The patient was not acutely ill last night, so she was
admitted to the Medicine team, with plan for ERCP today. She was
kept NPO and was administered IVF overnight.
  This morning, she was administered 4 U FFP to reverse her INR.
 After receiving 2 U FFP, she became hypoxic, with O2 sats
dropping to the 70s.  She was placed on 100% NRB with
improvement in her O2 sats to the 90s. Prior to dialysis, she
was given 100 mg IV Lasix, with urine output (non measured).  At
1:50 PM, she was transferred to the Hemodialysis Unit for
initiation of hemodialysis.  Approximately 1 L was removed, yet
the patient remained in respiratory distress, with O2 sats in
the low 90s on NRB.  At 2:30 PM, a respiratory code was called
since patient's O2 sats dropped to 70s on the NRB.  The patient
was emergently intubated.  ABG prior to intubation was
7.21/55/55.  EKG disclosed new ST segment depressions in the
inferior and lateral leads.  Following intubation, the patient's
SBP dropped to 80s.  She was administered approximately 500 cc
NS bolus, and required Dopamine transiently.  The patient was
transferred to the MICU for further management.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Respiratory Failure: On HD#2, the patient developed acute
respiratory distress.  The patient had recieved IVF in the ED
the nigtht before and that monring had recieved 4 units of FFP
for planned ERCP, the last two within one hour of respiratory
distress.  CXR demonstrated acute developement of bilateral
pulmonary infiltrates.  Ddx included cardiogenic pulmonary edema
versus TRALI.  The patient was taken for emergent HD; however,
depspite succesful diuresis, the patient required intubation for
respiratory failure.  TRALI work-up is pending at the time of
discharge.  The patient remained intubated in the MICU and
succesfully extubated on the second attempt.

2. Hypotension: After intubation, the patient became hypotensive
in the MICU requiring initiation of pressors.  She was found to
be adrenally insufficent by cortisyn stimulation test and
started on stress-dose hydrocortisone and fludircortisone.  In
addition, she required pressors and continued IV Unasyn for
possible sepsis, though blood cultures were negative.  The
patient's blood pressure improved and stablized.

3. Choledocholithasis: Demonstrated on admission RUQ US on
admission without transaminitis but with low-grade fever and
left-shift.  The patient was evaluted by Surgery and ERCP
service.  She was started on IV Unasyn.  Patient underwent ERCP
in MICU while intubated, which demonstrated dilated CBD but no
stones.  Patient had spinchterotomy.  The patient completed a 10
day course of IV Unsyn and will be discharged on two days.
Consideration should be given to possible outpatient
cholecystetomy.

4. GI Bleed: Post-ERCP, the patient dropped Hct and was foudn to
be guiac postitive.  Patient underwent repeat ERCP which
demonstrated spincterotomy bleed.  This required epiniephrine
injection.  Hct remained relatively stable, though she had a
possible rebleed several days later which stablized without
repeat scope.  ASA and coumadin were held [**2-3**] bleed and may be
safely restarted on [**2127-8-4**].  The patient's Hct remained stable
for the rest of her hospital course.  The patient will continue
on her PPI.

5. Coronary Artery Disease: During the patient's MICU stay, EKG
was noted to have
poor R wave progression.  An echocardiogram was obtained which
demonstrated regional LV dysfunction suggesting CAD.  Cardiac
enzymes demonstrated non-diagnostic elevated Tropnin T, felt
either secondary to demand or ESRD.  ASA was held [**2-3**] GI bleed
and the patient's beta-blocker was continued.  The patient will
need an outpatient evaluation of her coronaries, likely with ETT
MIBI when she is stable.  Again, ASA will be started [**2127-8-4**].

6. ESRD: The patient did well on her hemodilyasis schedule.  The
patient's prednisone was continued for her history of renal
vascultitis.

7. Hypothryoidism: Patient stable on levothyroxine.

History of Present Illness:
A [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with past medical history of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, Wegener's granulomatosis, recent
admission [**Date range (1) 2374**] for acute on chronic renal failure
with decision to initiate hemodialysis at that time and hospital
stay complicated by left lower lobe Moraxella pneumonia
presenting with altered mental status.  Per her daughter, the
patient was home this past week and accidentally took trazodone
50 mg two days prior to admission, which had been discontinued
due to confusion.  Her confusion/visual hallucinations improved
the day prior to admission.  She complained of increased
productive cough and oxygen requirement (previously intermittent
2L NC, now continuous) over the past two days, responding to an
increase in nebulizer treatments.  The patient was noted to be
lethargic this afternoon, responsive to sternal rub.  When
aroused, she was oriented x 3 and moving all extremities well,
however.  The patient was noted to be ""cold.""  She has not
complained of recent fevers, chills, chest pain, abdominal pain,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, erythema around line.
.
In the ED, initial VS T 96, HR 63, BP 77/55, RR 18 SaO2 98%
(oxygen not documented).  Per report, patient had poor
respiratory effort, became apneic, and was subsequently
intubated.  Chest x-ray showed bilateral effusions and left
lower lobe pneumonia.  Head CT negative for acute process.  A
right femoral line was placed for access.  She was given
etomidate and roccuronium for intubation, vancomycin 1 gm IV x
1, zosyn 4.5 gm IV x 1, 1L NS.  The patient was started on
levophed for hypotension peri-intubation, off within half an
hour.
.
On arrival to the MICU, she is responsive to tactile stimuli.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 46**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo F with past medical history of COPD,
Wegener's granulomatosis with resulting chronic kidney disease,
recent admission [**Date range (3) 2374**] for acute on chronic renal
failure, started on hemodialysis w/hospital stay c/b left lower
lobe Moraxella pneumonia admitted with recurrant moraxella
pneumonia and sepsis.

1)Moraxella pneumonia: Most likely explanation for respiratory
failure/hypotension in ED requiring intubation.  She was
successfully extubated on [**12-25**] and maintaining O2 sats on O2
via NC without e/o respiratory distress.  Her sputum culture
from [**2131-12-24**] is again growing Moraxella, no other new
organisms.  CXR continues to show same LLL infiltrate concerning
for partially treated pneumonia.  Concerning for endobronchial
lesion with postobstructive pneumonia however chest CT did not
show any underlying structural cause for recurrance of
pneumonia.  She did have bilateral pleural effusions which
appeared simple and did not appear to be parapneumonic.  She was
initially treated with vancomycin and zosyn however this was
changed to ceftriaxone once culture data returned with
moraxella.  She improved daily from a repiratory standpoint and
was on minimal to no oxygen on discharge.  She was changed to
cefpodoxime on discharge to be given only on hemodialysis days,
after dialysis as this antibiotic is renally cleared.

2)Altered mental status: Likely delirium in the setting of
infection, sedating meds, ICU stay especially in setting of
advanced age.  In addition, daughter reports that she took
trazodone two days prior to admission, which has caused
confusion in the past.  She had a CT head on admission without
acute process.  Her mental status cleared during her hospital
stay and treatment of pneumonia.

3)Coagulopathy: Her INR was 2 on admission, however climbed to
peak of 5.3 likley due to poor nutrition and antibiotics.  Her
coumadin was stopped [**12-25**] and held throughout the remainder of
her admission.  She was restarted on 1mg coumdain on discharge
with INR checks with dialysis. Her INR was 2.9 on the day of
discharge.

4)Chronic renal failure: Secondary to ANCA vasculitis. Decision
made to initiate HD last admission.  She was dialysed for volume
overload in the hospital and was dishcarged with plan for
dialysis at FMC - West Suburban Dialysis Center.  She was
continued on epogen with dialysis, nephrocaps, calcitriol,
calcium.

5)Anemia: Baseline mid-20s as of most recent [**12-10**] admission;
prior to that was in the low 30s. No signs or symptoms of active
bleeding, guaiac negative.   She was transfused one unit PRBC
with dialysis on [**12-26**] with stable hematocrit around 26
throughout the remainder of her hospitalization.  She should be
continued on epogen with dialysis.

6)Diarrhea - patient has developed diarrhea in setting of
multiple admissions and antibiotics.  She had one stool that was
negative for C. diff and was started on loperamide to decrease
stool output given skin breakdown.  She was also advised to eat
yogurt three times daily.  Diarrhea is most likely antibiotic
associated due to alteration of normal bowel flora, however she
will require two additional stool samples to rule out C.diff.
She will require monitoring of in's and out's and encouragement
for oral intake to prevent dehydration.

7)Skin Breakdown: During her admission she began developing skin
breakdown on her gluteal cleft likely due to a combination of
immobility due to acute illness and diarrhea as discussed above.
 She will require close monitoring of her skin and frequent
personal care to keep her buttocks clean and protected.

8)Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation:  Her metoprolol was initially
held in the ICU given sinus bradycardia and sepsis.  It was
resumed at home dose on [**12-26**] however given borderline blood
pressures, it was decreased to 75mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**12-27**].

9) Spiculated lesion on CT chest: as discussed in radiology
report, will need repeat CT in 3 months to reassess this lesion
for stability.

10)Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine

11)Code: Full

Secondary Diagnoses:
Anemia


Discharge Condition:
fair
O2 saturation 95% on 0.5L NC


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with confusion, low blood
pressure and low oxygen most likely due to a serious pneumonia.
You were intubated and sent to the ICU for care.  You improved
and were able to be extubated the following day.  You were
treated with antibiotics for pneumonia and your breathing
improved.  You had blood cultures, urine cultures and stool
cultures which did not show any evidence of infection.

You had dialysis with fluid removal as you were given a large
amount of IV fluids on admission for your infection which caused
swelling in your arms and fluid around your lungs.

You developed diarrhea during your admission which is most
likely due to antibiotics.  You were started on loperamide to
attempt to decrease the diarrhea and to prevent further skin
breakdown.

Medications:
1)You will be discharged on cefpodoxime to complete a 2 week
course of antibiotics.  This should be taken only on dialysis
days, after your dialysis.
2)You can take loperamide as needed to decrease your diarrhea.
3)Your coumadin was held during your admission but can be
restarted on discharge as your INR was down to 2.9.
4)Your metoprolol was decreased to 75mg twice daily as your
blood pressure was borderline low.
No other changes were made to your medications.

Please follow up as below.

Please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you have
any concerning symptoms including fevers, confusion, chest pain,
trouble breathing, low blood pressure or other worrisome
symptoms.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chronic right ankle infection with unstable
joint.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 66-year-old male with
a nonhealing right malleolar wound and fracture for the last
2 years who underwent a right ankle traction and open
reduction internal fixation. The patient has had multiple
admissions for wound infections and multiple IV antibiotic
courses. Most recent admission was [**2189-9-28**], for a
wound infection. The patient recently complained of a
temperature elevation on [**2189-11-30**], and now is to be
admitted to Dr.[**Name (NI) 1392**] service for continued IV
antibiotics. The patient initially was discharged on
daptomycin and followed by VNA.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Type 2 diabetes with triopathy,
endstage renal disease secondary to diabetes, status post
cadaver transplant in [**2182**], history of coronary artery
disease, status post CABG in [**2178**], history of peripheral
vascular disease, right ankle fracture in [**2188-6-6**], with an
open reduction internal fixation, status post hardware
removal, chronic osteomyelitis.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  Percocet, dicloxacillin 100 mg twice a day,
gabapentin 1600 mg twice a day, Lasix 20 mg twice a day,
Sensipar 30 mg daily, metoprolol 25 mg daily, ranitidine 150
mg daily. There are two other medications that the patient is
on, of which the handwriting is not decipherable at this
time.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a nonsmoker, is married and
lives with his spouse.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs 94.6, 94, 18, blood
pressure 144/88, oxygen saturation 93% in room air. Blood
sugar fingerstick was 291 on admission. General appearance:
Alert, cooperative white male in no acute distress. HEENT
exam: Mild right eye ptosis. Neck is supple without
lymphadenopathy or carotid bruits. Lungs are clear to
auscultation bilaterally. Chest is with a well healed median
sternotomy incision. Heart is a regular rate and rhythm with
a systolic ejection murmur II/VI, nonradiating. Abdomen is
soft, nontender, obese. Extremities: Right malleolus with
punctate lesion with draining and surrounding erythema. Pulse
exam shows palpable radial pulses, femoral pulses
bilaterally. The right DP and PT are dopplerable signals. The
left DP and PT are dopplerable signs. Neurological exam is
nonfocal.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the vascular
service. His dicloxacillin was continued. Vancomycin and
Flagyl were instituted. He was continued on his preadmission
medications. He was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] and advisement was
made for him to undergo a below the knee amputation. The
patient accepted the recommendation. Transplant nephrology
was consulted to follow the patient during his
hospitalization. [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted for hyperglycemic
management. Daily SK5 levels were obtained. He required
minimal adjustment in his immunosuppression. He continued on
his Lantus with a Humalog sliding scale with improvement in
his glycemic control. On [**2189-12-3**], he underwent a
right BKA without incident. He was transferred to the PACU in
stable condition. At the end of his surgical procedure
intraoperatively, the patient became hypotensive with
systolic blood pressure in the 60s and he was given Neo 200
mcg x2 and epinephrine 5 mg x2. The patient went into a
monomorphic VT 4 minutes at a rate of 130. He was given
lidocaine 100 mg IV bolus and amiodarone 125 mg over 15
minutes. The patient converted to sinus rhythm. An
intraoperative TEE showed severe biventricular failure.
Dopamine was started at 5 mcg/kg/minute. Blood pressure
improved. He was transferred to the PACU and then to the ICU
for continued care. Serial enzymes were obtained. Repeat echo
was obtained on the 28th which demonstrated left ventricular
wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained by 2-D
images. He has severely depressed left ventricular ejection
fraction. He had multiple regional wall motion abnormalities.
His aortic valve was moderately thickened leaflets. There
were no masses or vegetations on the aortic valve. No aortic
insufficiency. The mitral valve, tricuspid valve were normal
with trivial MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]. The pulmonic valve and artery were
unremarkable. The pericardium showed no pleural effusion.
Aortic valve area was calculated at 1.3 cm squared, normal is
3 cm squared. Gradient peak was 32 mm. There was no
intracardiac thrombus noted on the primary or the secondary
echo. The ejection fraction was calculated at 30% to 40%. IV
heparin was begun to maintain a goal PTT between 40 and 60.
The patient's Dobutamine was weaned with hopes to extubate.
Pulse exam remained unchanged. The right amputation site was
clean dry dressing. He remained on bedrest in the SICU.
Cardiac enzymes: Base was 20, peaked at 96 for the CK. CK MBs
were not obtained. His troponins were 0.01 and 0.03. The
patient's Swan was converted to a CVL on [**2189-12-4**].
The patient continued on heparin, was extubated and
transferred to the VICU for continued monitoring and care on
[**2189-12-5**]. Cardiology was requested to see the
patient on [**2189-12-6**], who felt the patient was
hemodynamically stable and his atrial fibrillation was rate
controlled. We should continue the heparin while his INR is
less than 2 and his goal INR should be [**1-9**], and recommend
metoprolol tartrate twice a day versus single dosing. They
recommended aspirin 81 mg and simvastatin 20 mg daily.
Hyperglycemia control remained relatively good. He did not
require adjustment in his Lantus. His premeal coverage was
adjusted. Vancomycin, ciprofloxacin and Flagyl were
discontinued on [**2189-12-7**]. The patient remained
afebrile. Foley was discontinued. Peripheral line was placed
and the central line was discontinued. The patient had been
advanced to a regular diet and ambulation to chair was begun.
On [**2189-12-8**], postoperative day 5, the patient
continues on IV heparin/Coumadinization conversion. Serial
coags were monitored. Physical therapy will see the patient
and make recommendations regarding disposition planning,
being a new amputation if he will go to rehabilitation. Will
talk to infectious disease, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2379**], regarding discontinue
the doxycycline. The remaining hospital course, the patient
will be discharged when medically stable and bed available at
rehabilitation. At the time of discharge, discharge
medication instructions will be dictated.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2074**]
Chief Complaint:
Direct transfer from [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital for STEMI, cath and
now stablized hct and transfered out of CCU

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization
Blood transfusion

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 2391**] is a 66-year-old male with hx HIV on HAART,
lymphoma, LUL lung adenocarcinoma s/p resection, hx CAD s/p PCI
with DES in [**5-17**] to proximal circumflex artery. In [**11-16**] he had
elective cath showing 90% restenosis at proximal edge of
previously placed stent, treated with overlapping Cyper stent.
Mid-RCA was 80% occluded and treated with DES as well. In [**2-18**]
pt had a left femoral artery to dorsalis pedis artery bypass
graft with an in situ greater saphenous vein graft. His plavix
was discontinued at that time. He was recently admitted on
[**2188-4-30**] w/ STEMI over III, F, taken to cath, where he had a DES
placed in the LCX for the vessel being occluded by a thrombus
proximally. Of note, at cath [**4-30**], he had a totally occluded
right external iliac artery. The pt was discharged home [**2188-5-3**].
Since that time, per the pt, he felt at baseline, with the
exception of intermittent left leg pain (s/p vascular surgery,
bypass) that would occasionally awaken him at night. He stated
he was up this morning at 4am b/c of this left leg pain, when he
developed a ""cold rough"" feeling in his esophagus similar to his
pain that he had with all of his prior MIs. He states it was a
[**5-24**] in severity. He took 1 nitro, and it resolved. He reports
he did not take his plavix yesterday and today. He noted
intermittent right sided chest pain as well last night, which
felt like ""gas pain"", + SOB, no diaphoresis, + nausea, no
vomiting. He states the feeling returned and then persisted,
took a 2nd nitro but it only decreased the pain to a [**2192-2-16**]. He
called 911.
.
In the ambulance, the pt's pain decr to [**1-25**] and he received
ASA, another nitro en route. His pain, however, only resolved
completely on nitro gtt at OSH where he was given ASA, IV
integrillin, IV heparin, started on nitro drip with full
resolution of pain, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for emergent cath. His
initial BP at OSH 130/75, down to 93/63 after nitro. Outside
labs with CK 60, other ezymes pending at time of transfer, BNP
17.
.
At [**Hospital1 18**], he was given plavix 600mg load prior to cath. In the
cath lab: LCX was totally occluded within proximal stents. A
wire was passed and flow was reestablished (likely development
of blood clots). 1 additional bare metal stent (no DES since he
had questionable compliance w/ plavix) placed distal to last
stent. Some non-occluding stenosis in the distal branches. Cath
was performed via radial artery (per lower ext arterial
disease). His right groin (femoral vein) developed a hematoma.
His left groin was not accessed given his c/o left leg pain post
surgery 2 months ago. He was subsequently transferred to the
floor. He then had BP drop to 90s/40s-50s and a pm HCT was found
to be 27.7 (6 point drop from pre-cath HCT). He is being
transferred to the CCU for unstable HCT and hematoma with labile
BP s/p catheterization today.
.
Brief CCU event: CT scan of abd neg for RP bleed. Neg groin for
psuedoaneurysm. Stable hct. Received total of 3 units of blood.

Brief Hospital Course:
66 year old male with HIV, CAD, recently admitted for STEMI
found to have 100% LCX lesion and stented w/ DES, who presented
with STEMI to OSH, and found to have total occlusion of proximal
LCX stent, now s/p bare metal stent placement. Pt was then found
to have a hematocrit drop and hypotension necessitating
transfuse to CCU, now stabilized.
.
Blood loss: Pt was s/p catheterization with R wrist for arterial
access and R groin for venous access. CT scan was performed, and
ruled out RP bleed and U/S ruled out AV fistula and
pseudoaneurysm. He received a total of 3 units PRBCs in CCU, and
his hct has been stable. Pt likely had blood loss during cath,
and in groin hematoma. After being transferred back to the floor
from the CCU, his Hct was stable. Low-dose metoprolol was
started the night before discharge, and he tolerated this with
SBP in the 100s to 110s.
.
Cardiac. Patient was admitted with a repeat STEMI secondary to
instent thrombosis. He had placement of a bare metal stent, and
was started on higher doses of plavix at 150 mg daily. He was
continued on aspirin and a high dose statin as well. His
antihypertensives were held due to hypotension, and restarted
prior to discharge.
He was not diuresed further, despite an elevated PCWP of 28 at
catheterization, due to hypotension. He remained in normal sinus
rhythm.
.
Hyperbilirubinemia: the pt was noted to have mild jaundice and
scleral icterus on [**5-12**]. LFTs were checked and his total
bilirubin was 6.6, direct bili was 0.2. His other LFTs were
normal. His hemolysis labs were normal. The hyperbilirubinemia
was felt to be most likely due to either reabsorption of the
large hematoma or a side effect from one of his HIV meds, most
likely atazanavir. His bilirubin continued to climb but he was
otherwise asymptomatic. A RUQ U/S showed small gallstones but no
evidence of cholecystitis or obstruction. His statin and HIV
meds were stopped on discharge.
.
HIV: Patient was continued on his outpatient HIV medications. He
was continued on prophylactic bactrim. He was continued on his
antidepressants.
.
Dispo. Patient was discharged to home with a stable hematocrit.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]F Russian-speaking h/o refractory nodular sclerosing Hodgkins
Lymphoma was brought in by EMS and admitted after her home
health care aide noted she was hypotensive to 88/40 and
confused.

In the ED, T 98.4 (rectal), HR 101, BP 102/53, RR 20, O2Sat 98%
on 3L. Incontinant of guaiac-positive stool.  Treated with 4 L
NS, vanco 1g IV, ceftazadime 1g IV, and flagyl 500mg IV.
Received 0.5 mg ativan and 2mg IV morphine for agitation.

Pt was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where she completed a 10-day course of
ceftazadime and vancomycin for urosepsis. A 7-day course of
metronidazole was also completed for empiric treatment of C.
Diff given loose stools in the setting of an elevated WBC count,
although all C. Diff assays were negative. Pt was stabilized and
was transferred to the floor for further care. At the time of
transfer, active issues were poor nutritional status,
thrombocytopenia and anemia.

On the floor, however, pt experienced an episode of new Afib
with RVR to 160s and hypotension to SBP 90-100s, as well as
respiratory distress after she received fluid resuscitation.
There was also a concern for tachy-brady syndrome because she
had pauses up to 4 sec on telemetry; EP curbside, however, felt
digoxin was not recommended.

Pt was therefore readmitted to the MICU.  While in the MICU, she
was started on vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam as she had
(1) sites of possible infection at the erosions under her
breasts and on her right hip, as well as question of PNA, (2)
rising WBC, reaching a high of nearly 17.  MICU course was also
marked by (1) hypotension, which responded to gentle NS boluses;
(2) low UOP believed to be [**2-22**] both hypovolemia and a low
baseline nitrogenous load/obligate urine output; and (3)
recurrent Afib, for which she was transitioned to amiodarone
400mg PO daily, to run for 7 days before titrating downward.

Pertinent Results:
[**1-8**] - CXR - IMPRESSION: Persistent right-sided effusion. No
definite consolidation. Routine PA and lateral films are
recommended for evaluation when feasible.

[**1-10**].  Echo.
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (probably 3) are mildly thickened. There
is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic
mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Based on [**2193**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2190-12-22**], there is no definite change.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]F with Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma initially
admitted for urosepsis, and who was transferred to the ICU with
hypotension and AFib with RVR.

# Goals of Care: The patient had a long hospital course with
many family meetings reagarding goals of care.  On [**2194-1-21**] the
patient was made DNR/DNI but the family continued to want ICU
transfers and pressors if needed, regardless of comfort to the
patient.  The patient was tranferred to the unit on [**2194-1-30**].
She was started on levophed for hypotension but eventually a
decision was made that it was medically futile to escalate care.
 Care was not escalated and she expired at 14:26 on [**2194-2-2**].
The family declined autopsy.

# Afib with RVR: Pt experienced transient episodes of Afib to
150's controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol, with spontaneous
conversion but with multiple episodes of up to 4 second pauses
and bradycardia to 40, likely junctional escape.  Digoxin
considered unfavorable in this patient.  In the MICU, pt was
started on amiodarone gtt, and converted to amiodarone PO.  When
the patient was readmitted to the ICU on [**2194-1-30**], she was having
increased pauses up to 20 seconds.  Her amiodarone was stopped.


# Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: The patient was anemia and
thrombocytopenic throughout the admission thought to be
secondary to marrow infiltration of lymphoma. Was transfused
total of 3 units PLT (1 unit each on [**1-14**] and [**1-19**])
with a transfusion threshold of 10. Will continue to trend
platelets, transfuse for bleeding or platelet count < 10.
Transfused 1 unit platelets with good bump on [**1-25**].  Also, the
patient has been receiving pRBC transfusions for HCT <24 (total
of four units since [**2194-1-12**]).

# Hypotension: Early on in the admission, she was having
hypotensive episodes after furosemide but was responsive to
fluid blosues of 250 cc.  ECHO demonstrated impaired LV
relaxation and given elevated WBC, there was concern for
distributive shock.  Once no longer fluid responsive, she was
started on phenylephrine gtt, which was weaned off.  She was
again hypotension later in her admission thought to be secondary
to systemic vasodilation.  She was started on levophed but a
decision was then made to not escalate care.

# Infection: WBC elevated with multiple possible infectious
sources which could contribute to hypotension (ie, skin erosions
under breasts, course breath sounds with ?PNA).  Vanc and piptaz
started on [**1-22**]; cultures of blood and urine pending; sputum not
obtainable at this point.  CDiff repeated with toxin B. C Diff
neg, thus D/C flagyl [**1-24**].  Now with GNR from skin swab.

# Hypernatremia: Noted to be periodically hypernatremic since
admission (Na 148-150), due to free water defecit. She has been
getting slow infusions of D5W as she has poor po intake and have
not been able to keep up her free water intake.

# Altered Mental Status: Increased lethargy compared to baseline
on admission most likely [**2-22**] metabolic encephalopathy due to
infection and acute renal failure, with slight improvement after
resolution of urosepsis. Head CT negative for acute process.
Thyroid studies show elevated TSH but this may be c/w sick
euthyroid syndrome.

# Respiratory Distress: Early in her admission, the patient
developed labored breathing after receiving 1 L NS for
hypotension c/w flash pulmonary edema.  Diuresis with furosemide
gtt lead to hypotension; albumin resuscitation lead to repeated
respiratory distress.  On [**2194-1-30**] she was on the floor and had a
witnessed aspiration event and needed 100% Hi Flow mask.  While
in the ICU her O2 was weaned but again aspirated and had
increasing O2 requirements.

# Acute renal failure: Pt noted to have Cr up to 1.7 on
admission from presumed baseline of 1.0, returned to baseline of
0.9. Likely was pre-renal due to dehydration and hypotension due
to sepsis.  Later in her hospital course, the patient was
hypotensive and her creatinine again began to rise thought
secondary to ATN.

# Hypothyroidism:  Initially treated with levothyroxine 12.5 mcg
IV daily (half home dose).  T3 low. TSH elevated.  Resumed home
dose 1/4.

# Anasarca: Pt has diffuse edema and large bilateral pleural
effusions likely third-spacing from malnutrition given low
albumin (2.8 on admission, then 2.2) and poor po intake.
Diuresis has been difficult due to hypotension as detailed
above.  Continue to monitor.

# Urosepsis: Admitted with hypotension due to urosepsis
requiring pressor support. Urine cultures from [**1-9**] were
positive for E.coli, and pt completed treated with vancomycin
and ceftazidime x10 days.  Repeat UCx [**2194-1-19**] grew out yeast,
which was not treated.  Another repeat UCx [**1-22**] final again grew
out yeast.

# Right Hip pain: Pain due to destruction of the right
acetabulum consistent with progressive lymphoma on CT scan.
There is dramatic medial displacement of the right femoral head
secondary to lack of remaining osseous support. Stable
destruction of the right posterior sacroiliac joint and
surrounding right sacral ala and iliac bone. The patient's pain
is being controlled with fentanyl and lidocaine patches.

# Bilateral pleural effusion: R>L, thought most likely due to
agressive hydration in the setting of sepsis and
hypoalbuminemia.  Was difficult to effect a significant diurese
in MICU due to development of hypotension in response to
furosemide. Appears slightly improved on CXR from [**2194-1-17**],
unchanged on [**1-20**] CXR.

# Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Seen by oncology, no
interventions at this time. Likely with bone marrow infiltration
causing anemia and thrombocytopenia above, as pt with low retic
count and no evidence of hemolysis.  No further treatment per
oncology.

# Coagulopathy: Mild, likely due to nutritional deficiency.
Encourage PO intake and trend LFTs, coags.

IMPRESSION: There is no definite evidence for pneumonia, and
there is a slightly improved appearance to the pulmonary
vasculature compared to prior study suggesting improved fluid
status.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 56F with decompensated EtOH cirrhosis w/ encephalopathy and
esophageal varices, admitted to ICU after being found down,
intubated.
.
# Altered mental status: Likely [**12-28**] hepatic encephalopathy, PA
lateral CXR negative, sputum cx. negative. Has had multiple
admissions for encephalopathy [**12-28**] med noncompliance, though pt.
and family report compliance with meds and 2-3 times daily BMs.
No leukocytosis or abd. pain, with minimal ascites, so unlikely
SBP. Sputum gram stain with G+ cocci, but cultures negative and
no e/o PNA on CXR. Tox screen negative on admission. CT head
negative.
- continued lactulose q6h with PRN lactulose enemas
- continued rifaximin, ursodiol at outpatient dose
- MVI/thiamine/folate
Pt.'s mental status cleared quickly and pt. was sent home on
increased lactulose/rifaxamin to prevent encephalopathy.
.
# Respiratory failure: intubated for airway protection, as
initially unresponsive,  MS quickly improved with lactulose, and
pt. was extubated.
.
# EtOH cirrhosis: Decompensated with encephalopathy, ascites,
and varices. Currently with minimal ascites. Last EGD [**4-28**], no
known h/o melena or BRBPR, guaiac negative on exam. MELD 16.
Thrombocytopenia within baseline. Tbili trended down during
admission.  Guaiacs negative during admission.
.
# Anemia: baseline wanders from 25-->36, hct stable during
admit.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient's temperature was 98.4.
Heart rate 76 to 79.  Blood pressure 90/50.  Respirations 15.
Sat 94 to 99% on 2 liters.  In general, well appearing and in
no acute distress.  Pupils are equal, round and reactive to
light.  No scleral icterus.  Oropharynx is clear.
Conjunctiva were slightly pale.  No lymphadenopathy.  No
bruits.  JVP approximately 8 cm.  Chest rales at the right
base.  Cardiac regular.  S1 and S2.  No murmurs.  Abdomen was
benign, soft, nontender.  Good bowel sounds.  He had a
midline ventral hernia, which was soft. Liver was palpated 2
cm below the costal margin.  The patient was OB positive in
the Emergency Department.  Extremities revealed 1+ pedal
edema with venostasis changes bilaterally.  Skin examination
had no rashes.  The patient s alert and oriented times three
with a chronic left foot drop.

INITIAL LABORATORIES:  White blood cell count 6.3, hematocrit
31.4, which then dropped to 24.3, baseline is 41.  Platelets
138.  SMA 7 notable for a sodium of 136, K of 4.7, bicarb 24,
BUN 32, creatinine 0.5, glucose 158, INR 2.3.  Dilantin level
was 3.0.  ALT 35, AST 51, alkaline phosphatase 203.  Total
bilirubin .5, LDH 215, albumin 3.0.  Enzymes were cycled,
which were negative.  The patient's electrocardiogram
revealed normal sinus rhythm, PR prolongation at 206.  Left
axis deviation, inferior Qs, all of which were old.   There
were some new T wave flattening in V2 to V6.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Gastrointestinal bleed:  The patient
was admitted with melena likely an upper gastrointestinal
bleed given history of abdominal aortic aneurysm, question of
enteric fistula.  Given history of hemochromatosis and early
cirrhosis, question of varices, given history of reflux
symptoms, question of esophagitis, gastritis.  The patient
was again admitted with gastrointestinal bleed and was typed
and crossed.  He was initially transfused 2 units for a
hematocrit of 24.  He had two peripheral intravenouses in
place.  INR was corrected with vitamin K 2 mg and 4 units of
fresh frozen platelets and hematocrit revealed a change from
24 up to 26 after 4 units.  INR corrected to 1.7.  The
patient  was also started on Protonix 40 intravenous b.i.d.
Aspirin and Coumadin  were held.  The patient underwent an
esophagogastroduodenoscopy on the following morning, which
revealed grade 1 esophageal varices and mild gastritis
esophagitis as well as portal gastropathy.  There was no
active bleeding at any site.  The patient then underwent an
abdominal CT, which was negative for aortic enteric fistula.
On the following day the patient underwent a colonoscopy,
which was normal up until the ascending colon.  However, they
were not able to go all the way to the cecum and recommended
virtual colonoscopy in the future and the patient had then
underwent a repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy with banding
times four to the esophageal varices.  The patient will need
a repeat banding procedure in ten days.  After the banding
the patient was started on Sucralfate 1 gram q.i.d. and was
continued on Protonix.  Again aspirin and Coumadin were held
throughout.  After 4 units hematocrit stabilized from 24 up
to 32 and remained stable at 32 upon discharge.

2.  Hypotension:  The patient was initially in the systolics
in the 90s likely hypovolemic in the setting of a
gastrointestinal bleed.  However, given the history of
cardiac disease the patient's enzymes were cycled times
three, which were negative.  He was resuscitated with fluid,
fresh frozen platelets and packed red cells and blood
pressure remained stable throughout.  After the
esophagogastroduodenoscopy the Atenolol was switched to
Nadolol given the history of cirrhosis and varices and
Zestril was held up until discharge due to low blood
pressures.

3.  Coronary artery disease:  Patient with a history of
myocardial infarction in [**2180**] and [**2182**] and is status post
stent of the percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty
in [**2182**].  Enzymes were cycled, which were negative.  Aspirin
and Coumadin were held due to gastrointestinal bleed.  Beta
blocker and ace were initially held due to low blood
pressures.  Lipitor was held secondary to new cirrhosis.  The
patient was restarted on Nadolol upon discharge, however,
aspirin, Coumadin, Zestril and Lipitor were held prior to
discharge to be restarted by primary care physician at his or
her discretion.

4.  Deep venous thrombosis:  Patient with recurrent left
lower extremity deep venous thrombosis, but admitted with
gastrointestinal bleed.  INR 2.3, Coumadin was held due to
multiple procedures and held upon discharge.  The patient
will undergo repeat banding in ten days after which time the
patient may or may not resume anticoagulation per primary
care physician.

5.  Hemachromatosis:  The patient with hemachromatosis for
long standing, now with evidence of cirrhosis on examination.
The patient will continue with further phlebotomies as per
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and may need further workup for cirrhosis.

6.  History of abdominal aortic aneurysm:  Patient ruled out
enteric fistula with negative abdominal CT.

7.  Seizure disorder:  The patient was given additional dose
of Dilantin 400 times one and then restarted on his regular
does of 300 and will continue on his regular dose.  No
further seizure activity.

8.  Diabetes:  The patient was initially held NPO diabetic
medications due to NPO status.  Was covered with a sliding
scale.  Sugars remained stable and can restart Glyburide upon
discharge.  Metformin held secondary to cirrhosis.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Esophageal varices s/p banding.
2.  Portal gastropathy.

Service:


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was a 73-year-old
female admitted to the CCU on [**2182-2-18**] with hyperkalemia and
bradycardia.  The patient had a past medical history
significant for hypertension, glaucoma, and breast cancer
treated with lumpectomy, XRT in [**2176**].  She was in her usual
state of health until [**12-2**] when she began to note shortness
of breath.  She saw her PCP and performed [**Name Initial (PRE) **] chest x-ray,
which revealed a right upper lobe density.  This was followed
up with a CT scan, which revealed a lobulated mass of 2.3 cm
in the posterior segment of the right lower lobe and
bilateral lobe interstitial fibrosis.  Follow-up PET scan was
nondiagnostic.  The patient had a mediastinoscopy, which
showed no evidence of malignancy or lymph nodes.  Lung biopsy
was performed, which revealed pulmonary fibrosis.  Subsequent
spirometry revealed a mild restrictive defect.  The entire
picture was thought to represent UIP.

On [**2182-2-18**], she presented to the [**Hospital1 **]
[**First Name (Titles) 2142**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] with a complaint of nausea, vomiting, and
diarrhea times several days.  In the waiting room, she
developed presyncope.  She was urgently brought to the trauma
bay, there her heart rate was in the 30s with the EKG
revealing a junctional rhythm.  Her SBP was in the 80s.
Attempts made to place a temporary pacing wire but during the
procedure the patient suffered respiratory arrest.  She was
intubated and resuscitated, and a line was successfully
placed.  Subsequent labs revealed a potassium of 9.8.  The
patient was treated with calcium bicarb, insulin, and glucose
and admitted to CCU.

In the CCU, the patient was started on Levophed and dopamine
for hypotension.  Swan-Ganz catheter was placed to evaluate
her hypotension and revealed an SVR of 2473 with a cardiac
output of 2.2.  Two hours later, the cardiac output was 6.5
and SVR was 898 after pressors were weaned down.  Urgent TTE
revealed normal systolic function, no pericardial effusion.
Potassium dropped to 4.3 after 1 day.  The patient was
empirically treated with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl
for hypotension, which was thought possibly due to sepsis.
By hospital day 3, she was off pressors, her white blood
count was 16.1.  She was successfully extubated, and her
potassium remained normal.  By hospital day 4, she continued
to have mild respiratory distress despite being extubated.
She was thought to be in mild CHF.  She was diuresed.
Levofloxacin and vancomycin were continued for possible
pneumonia.  By hospital day 5, she developed worsening
respiratory distress, and the patient agreed to elective
intubation.  She was then transferred to the MICU for further
workup and care.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension.

Glaucoma.

Breast cancer.

UIP.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Verapamil.
2. Propranolol.
3. Tamoxifen.
4. Xalatan eye drops.
5. Betoptic eye drops.
6. Calcium carbonate.
7. Aspirin.
8. Folate.
9. Vitamin E.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission to the MICU, temperature
98.9 degrees, blood pressure 126/61, and pulse 108.  The
patient was sedated and intubated.  Her lungs revealed
diffuse crackles bilaterally.  Cardiac exam was within normal
limits.  Abdomen was benign.  Lower extremity revealed no
edema.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA:  On admission to the MICU included
a white count of 21.9, hematocrit of 29.3, and  platelets of
85.

Chest x-ray on admission to MICU revealed persistent
bilateral upper lobe patchy opacities, may represent
interstitial edema plus aspiration.  Continued patchy
atelectasis within the left lower lobe and small left pleural
effusion.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted
to the Medical Intensive Care Unit with presumed diagnosis of
sepsis.  Subsequently, she developed a picture consistent
with ARDS and required multiple pressors.  After several days
in the CCU, she was on 3 different pressors and was unable to
maintain her blood pressure.  She was requiring increasing
ventilatory support.  A discussion was held with the family
who decided that the patient will be made DNI/DNR due to the
fact that CPR was likely to be unhelpful if the patient
arrested.  On [**2182-2-28**] at 03:15 p.m., the patient was
pronounced dead.  The family was at the bedside.

Reason for ICU admission: ROMI, coffee ground emesis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endoscopy

History of Present Illness:
HPI:
68 y.o. man with HTN presented to PCP for routine visit on day
of admission, c/o 2 months of worsening DOE and chest pressure
with exertion. He reports having a stress test 1 year ago which
was stopped after 3 minutes for hypertension (SBP in the 230s).
He had no symptoms and no ST wave changes. In addition, he
complains of severe heartburn (different than his chest
pressure) intermittently every few days x 3 months, along with
violent coughing fits which cause him to vomit dark brown
liquid. He denies frank blood in his emesis. The heartburn is
worse at night with lying flat. He denies NSAID use, but does
admit to drinking at least [**2-9**] drinks of burbon daily.
.
He was referred to the ED for concern of ACS. In the ED, he was
afebrile, HR 70s, BP 116/73m RR 16, and 97% RA. Hct was 41. His
trop was negative but ECG showed TWI in V1-V3 which were new. He
was given ASA 325, Lopressor, and started on nitroglycerin and
heparin gtt. Became hypotensive with nitro to SBP 80s, BP
responded to 2L NS. He then started to vomit brown colored,
guiac positive emesis. The heparin and nitro drips were stopped.
He was given IV protonix and Reglan. He was admitted to MICU for
further monitoring/ROMI.

.
CXR [**2143-11-22**]:
AP upright chest radiograph is obtained. A small amount of left

basilar atelectasis is noted. There is no evidence of pneumonia,
CHF. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
unremarkable. Mildly unfolded thoracic aorta noted. Visualized
osseous structures are intact.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumonia or CHF
.
[**2143-11-22**].
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF 70%) The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right
ventricular systolic function is normal. The aortic root is
moderately dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is
moderately dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. There are
focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Mild to moderate ([**1-8**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2142-12-6**], the findings are similar.
.
[**2143-11-25**].  EGD.
Severe esophagitis in the middle third of the esophagus and
lower third of the esophagus compatible with severe reflux
esophagitis (biopsy)
Erythema in the antrum compatible with gastritis (biopsy,
biopsy)
Erythema and congestion in the second part of the duodenum
compatible with duodenitis (biopsy)
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 2469**] is a 68 y.o. man with PMH significant
for HTN and alcohol abuse, admitted for DOE and chest pressure.
Patient was ruled out for MI, but developed coffee ground emesis
while on heparin drip.  EGD showed severe esophagitis and
gastritis.
.
Upper GI bleed.  Patient developed coffee-ground emesis in ED in
setting of chronic heartburn and alcohol abuse while on heparin
drip.   EGD showed severe esophagitis and gastritis, likely due
to chronic alcohol use.  Hct fell to 32 from 42 on admission,
but patient did not require transfusions.  He was sent home on
PPI [**Hospital1 **]. Gastric biopsies for H. pylori were pending at time of
discharge.
.
Chest pressure/ SOB.  Patient presented with CP and SOB on
exertion.  He has no history of CAD.  He had a stress test one
year ago which was terminated early due to hypertension.
Cardiac enzymes were negative.  He was initally started on a
heparin drip in the ED due to concern for unstable angina, but
this was stopped when patient developed coffee ground emesis.
His antihypertensives were intially held, but resumed on
hospital day 2.  A lipid panel was checked and his LDL was in
the 40s.  He was advised to get outpatient stress test and PFTs.
 Patient has a significant smoking history and CSR showed
hyperinflation, suggesting that his DOE may be pulmonary in
origin.
.
Alcohol abuse.  Patient has history of alcoholism and quit
drinking for 20 years and now drinks daily.  He denies history
of DTs or seizure.  He was tremulous and required a CIWA scale.
He was given thiamine, folate, and multivitamin during his
hospitalization.
.
Transaminitis.  Patient had mildly elevated LFTs that were
thought to be due to alcohol hepatitis.  Hepatitis serologies
were sent, but were pending at time of discharge.

etiology (?congenital hypoplasia), recurrent bronchitis in
winter, OSA, obesity, HTN who presented with 1 week of
productive cough, progresssive SOB, and over the past 2 days
weakness and fatigue to the point he was falling asleep at work.
He tried increasing his albuterol use but this did not help so
he came to the emergency room.

[**2-12**] MRSA screen pending
[**2-12**] Urine culture and legionella- negative
[**2-12**] RSV screen negative

Imaging:
[**2-12**] EKG: Sinus tachycardia. Right bundle-branch block. No
previous tracing available for comparison.

[**2-12**] CXR:
SINGLE FRONTAL PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST: As compared to prior
study there is minimal increase in right mid - lower lung
opacity . Right lower lobe pleural thickening is grossly stable.
Bullous changes denoted by relative lucency in the right upper
lobe are again noted and unchanged. Prominent right mediastinal
- paratracheal soft tissue remains unchanged. Left lung is
clear. Heart is not enlarged. The aortic contour is grossly
unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Minimal interval increase in opacification of the
right mid -
lower lung is better evaluated on subsequent CT from same day.

[**2-12**] CTA Chest:
1. No pulmonary embolus.
2. Right lung volume loss could be due to a congenital anomaly
or pulmonary infection early in life.
3. Persistent area of round atelectasis in the right lower lobe
with
increased size slightly since [**2166**].
4. New subpleural septal thickening in the left upper lobe and
medial basal left lower lobe, new since [**2166**] and suggestive of
an interstitial fibrosis.
5. Mildly enlarged 13-mm prevascular lymph node.

Given the pulmonary interstitial findings and mildly enlarged
lymph node,
followup high-resolution CT is suggested, preferrably in 3
months if not
needed earlier.

[**2-14**] Transthoracic echocardiogram:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
right atrial pressure is indeterminate. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size, and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated
with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal
systolic septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure overload. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Right ventricular cavity
enlargement with free wall hypokinesis and moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. Mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic
function.
This constellation of findings is suggestive of a primary
pulmonary process, e.g., pulmonary embolism.

Brief Hospital Course:
In the ED, initial vs were: T: 99.5 P109 BP101/56 R24 79% on RA
on presentation, 100% on NRB. Labs notable for WBC of 5, HCT
34.5, sodium of 131 and creatinine of 1.0. Patient was given
ceftriaxone and azithromycin, nebs, and methylprednisone.  He
had a CXR which was possibly suggestive of RML pneumonia, and a
CTA that showed no signs of PE but did reveal some increased
interstitial markings in the RUL and RLL, more consistent with a
chronic process vs. pneumonia. the patient was admitted to the
ICU for monitoring on [**2-12**]. He had in past refused CPAP for his
OSA but accepted it and reported he had an unusually restful
night. He was transferred to the medicine floor on [**2-13**].

#  Hypoxia: His increased cough and the CT and chest Xray
imaging were most consistent with a right middle lobe pneumonia
with underlying chronic pneumonic process, and he will need
another high-resolution chest CT in 3 months to evaluate
progression of these findings. In the ICU, he continued
antibiotic treatment for CAP. He did not receive further
steroids. He had an Echo that showed RV enlargement, free wall
hypokinesis & moderate elevation of PASP. Although these
findings were consistent with possible pulmonary embolism, he
had a CTA on admission that was negative for PE. Pulmonary was
consulted and felt his right heart findings could be related to
his underlying known chronic lung disease and sleep apnea rather
than PE. After discussion with his PCP and pulmonologist, he was
discharged to have a repeat sleep study performed and follow-up
TTE in 1 month.  Patient was encouraged to start using home
CPAP.

# Hyponatremia: He was noted to be mildly hyponatremic at
admission, possibly due to salt-wasting from his HCTZ use. This
mild hyponatremia resolved with a liter of normal saline.

# Obstructive sleep apnea: He is now agreeable to trialing CPAP.
He was told he should have an outpatient sleep study as above.

# Normocytic Anemia: His hematocrit was slightly lower than
recent baseline, and iron studies were consistent with chronic
inflammation.  This will be further worked up as an outpatient.

You came to the hospital with shortness of breath and fatigue.
You were briefly in the intensive care unit for close monitoring
and your breathing improved with antibiotics and steroids.  You
were found to have pneumonia and are being treated with
antibiotics.  You had an echocardiogram of your heart that
showed some strain on the right side of your heart, and this is
likely due to your lung disease.  Please follow-up with your PCP
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) 1022**] and your pulmonologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as below.  You have
also been scheduled to see Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] in sleep medicine to
discuss your sleep apnea.

The following changes were made to your medications:
Started levofloxacin, an antibiotic, once daily.  You should
take this for 4 more days.

Followup Instructions:
Please follow-up with your PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) 1022**], on [**2-21**] at 4:20pm.  You
should have another echocardiogram done in 1 month to evaluate
your heart function.

You have an appointment to see Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**], a sleep physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
[**2-22**] at 8 AM, [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] building [**Location (un) **] to discuss your
sleep apnea. You should be fitted for a CPAP machine at home to
treat your obstructive sleep apnea.  If you need to reschedule,
you can call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 612**].

Please follow-up with Pulmonary (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**3-22**] at

A CT of the chest showed subpleural septal thickening in the
left upper and medial basal lower lobes, new since [**2166**], and a
mildly enlarged 13-mm prevascular lymph node. Given these
findings, you should have a second high-resolution CT in the
next 3 months to determine whether these changes resolve on
their own.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 54M with hx of ETOH abuse, HCV, presenting
with AF with RVR, Chest Pain in the setting of ETOH
intoxication.
.
#: AF with RVR: Pt was in AF with RVR at presentation, which was
a new finding from prior EKGs. EKG showed no evidence of
ischemia. Pt was started on dilt gtt in ED and was transitioned
to PO metoprolol after arriving the ICU. HR was stable in 90s at
rest. Patient left AMA without waiting to receive his
prescriptions or cardiology follow-up. He was instructed to
return to the ED for palpitations, chest pain, SOB or any other
symptoms. He was instructed to follow up with his PCP.
.
# ETOH Intoxication: Pt presented with ETOH level of 412 and was
intoxicated. Lactate elevated but quickly trended down. He
received banana bag, and PO folate and thiamine. Electrolytes
were normal. Patient was monitored on CIWA scale in the ICU and
received Valium prn. SW was consulted. However, patient left
AMA. He stated he planned to take his home dose Campral and
continue attending AA meetings. He lives in a recovery home and
was instructed to have EMS notified if he experiences shaking,
confusion or any other symptoms.
.
#. Chest pain:
Pt presented with atypical chest pain in the setting of
intoxication that was reproducible on palpation. He denies
trauma but had been lifting heavy boxes recently. Pt evaluated
by Cards while in ED who felt that pain was non-cardiac. ASA
325mg and Nitroglycerin x1. One set of CE was significant for
elevated CK but normal troponin. DDx includes muscluoskeletal,
no evidence of PNA or ACS. PE unlikely given reproducibility.
.
# Anemia: Hct 30 on arrival. Near prior baseline. No evidence of
GI Bleed, no known prior hx of varies.
.
# HCV: Currently not receiving treatment. [**Hospital6 1597**],
records confirmed that Hep C antibody was confirmed to be
positive [**2143-6-2**]. HCV genotype was type IB, and RNA viral load
was
996,000 copies at that time.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1865**]
Chief Complaint:
 Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
* interview conducted with the aid of Ms. [**Known lastname 1862**] daughter
.
History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 86 y/o F with
history of nephrotic CRI, renal artery stenosis, and CHF, who
presented with hypertensive emergency and heart failure. The
patient reports that she was in her usual state of health until
3 days prior to admission. At that time, her BP was 220 systolic
@ home and she noticed mild SOB. On the night prior to
admission, she developed increasing SOB. Per the patient's
daughter, she had been taking her medications as prescribed. She
denies chest pain throughout this time. She was brought in by
daughter to [**Name (NI) **] for evaluation and was found to have BP 202/40
with a K of 5.9. She was treated with kayexalate 30, lasix 40
IV, clonidine 0.3 mg PO X 1, and levoflox 750 mg IV x 1.
.
The patient was initially admitted to the floor, where she was
found to have the following vitals: 98.3 226/68 68 90% 5LNC (mid
80s on 2LNC), 96% on face tent, RR > 40. As she was acutely
dyspneic and in acute failure, she was given 100mg IV lasix and
Diuril (on the advice of Renal consultants), w/ good effect->
UOP 350cc in ~1hour. She did not receive any nitrates or
morphine at the time. On MICU evaluation was 99% on shovel mask,
but still RR>40. Appeared comfortable, JVP ~9 cm. At that time,
she denied HA, visual changes, CP, urinary changes, no abd pain,
N/V/D. In the MICU, she was aggressively diuresed and placed on
her usual blood pressure regimen. Overnight [**Date range (1) 1873**], she did
not receive all of her blood pressures meds as her BPs were in
the 110s/120s overnight. She did receive all doses of clonidine
and hydralazine on [**5-9**].
.
Her daughter tells me that her edema is less than usual, but
that her right leg is chronically larger than the left. She has
been using several pillows to sleep at home. She denies PND. She
is not on supplemental O2 at home. Generally BP at home is 170s
(per PCP 160s in office at baseline).
.
Pt was diagnosed with w/ RLL PNA by her PCP and tx [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/
levofloxacin X 10 days about 4 weeks ago. Since that time, the
daughter has been living with the pt X 3 weeks. Her cough has
persisted per the daughter, but the patient did improve greatly
following antibiotics.
.
At the present time, the patient says she is comfortable. She
denies chest pain. She continues to make adequate urine.

Pertinent Results:
Studies:
[**2194-5-8**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Moderate congestive heart failure,
worse since the exam of one month ago.
.
[**2194-5-8**] ECHO: TTE Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is moderate
symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF 60%).
.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). Moderate
(2+) aortic
regurgitation is seen.
.
There is severe mitral annular calcification. There is a
minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal mitral
stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**1-28**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The
supporting structures of the tricuspid valve are
thickened/fibrotic.
.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
a small pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2193-9-19**], borderline mitral stenosis is now evident.
The mitral regurgitation, which is almost certainly
underestimated on this study, is probably increased.
.
[**2194-5-11**] CXR TWO VIEWS: Comparison with the previous study done
[**2194-5-9**]. There is interval improvement in interstitial pulmonary
edema. The mild pulmonary vascular congestion persists. Streaky
density at the lung bases is consistent with subsegmental
atelectasis. There is a moderate right pleural effusion and
small left pleural effusion. An underlying right basilar
consolidation cannot be excluded. The heart and mediastinal
structures are unchanged.

IMPRESSION: Interval improvement in congestive heart failure.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 86 year old female with probable endstage
renal failure not on HD, who presented with hypertensive
emergency and congestive heart failure.  She was admitted to the
medical floor but immediately was sent to the MICU for
respiratory distress. There she was agressively diuresed and
then returned to the medical floor.
.
* Hypertensive Emergency: Her HTN is likely secondary to her
ESRD.  The elevated blood pressures caused flash pulmonary edema
and congestive heart failure.  She was given blood pressure
medications to help control her BP within the range of 130-160
as she probably is dependent on some hypertension for perfusion.
 Her baseline BP is reportedly 160 at home.  Ultimately she was
placed on clonidine 0.2 mg TID, hydralazine 100mg TID, norvasc
10mg qday, metoprolol 12.5mg TID, lasix 40mg [**Hospital1 **].
.
* ? SVT: During her initally presentation, she did have some
runs of SVT noted on telemetry.  Once she was diuresed no
further episodes were noted.  She was continued on metoprolol
12.5 mg TID for given episodes of ? SVT.
.
* Congestive Heart Failure: Likely from worsening renal failure
and hypertensive urgency. She was agressively diuresed in the
MICU with IV furosemide overnight and then with PO furosemide on
the medical floor. She was also continued on hydralazine for
afterload reduction.
.
* Renal Failure: A renal consult was obtained.  They felt that
there was no acute needs for dialysis at present although they
have been discussing starting HD with the patient and her family
for a while now.  This discussion was continued throughout the
admission and the patient and her family were resistent to
starting.  They agreed to meet with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1366**] in the next two
weeks to discuss getting a tunnelled cath and starting HD.
Throughout admission, her electrolytes were monitored closely as
she had boughts of hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia and acidosis.
 These were controlled with standard measures.
.
* Hyperkalemia: Received Kayexalate in ED. Usually takes
kayexalate twice a week as outpatient, so this was restarted as
an inpatient.
.
* Anemia: Baseline Hct appears to be 29-33 and now 25. Iron 45,
ferritin 149, TIBC 269 in [**3-5**]. Per renal recommendation, she
was transfused 1 unit PRBC on [**2194-5-12**] without complications.
.
* Bacteremia: WBC count 10 on admission and down to 6.4 today.
Has been afebrile but blood cultures showed 2/4 bottles with
staph coag negative- likely contaminant. Before speciation
returned, she was treated with vancomycin dosed by level. Once
it was found to be coag negative staph, the vancomycin was
discontinued. All subsequent surveillence cultures were
negative.
.
* Code status: Full - discussed w/ patient's daughter.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 86F with h/o colon cancer, ESRD on
hemodialysis, diastolic CHF, pulmonary hypertension, and prior
cephalic vein thrombosis who presented to the ED on [**8-15**] with
dyspnea.

The patient's dialysis catheter became dislodged [**8-12**].
Consequently she missed her normal dialysis session [**8-13**]. On
[**8-14**] she had a new tunneled catheter placed, but was not
dialyzed. The afternoon of [**8-14**] her daughter noticed that the
patient seemed increasingly dyspneic and was hypertensive to
200's. She was given hydralazine and clonidine and the BP
improved to 160's. She called her daughter ~3am on [**8-15**] due to
worsening dyspnea. The patient denies any accompanying headache,
vision changes, chest discomfort, palpitations, nausea,
vomiting, cough, weakness or loss of sensation. EMS was called,
and she was given CPAP with some relief of her dyspnea. Per her
daughter, similar symptoms have occurred 3 times in the past.

In the ED her vitals were BP 258/61 RR 28 O2 100% on CPAP, 89%
on room air (temperature was not recorded). She was started on a
nitroglycerin drip, and given calcium and bicarbonate for a
potassium of 7.1. She was weaned off NIPPV, with O2 saturation
of 97% on 3L NC. She was subsequently transferred to the ICU for
further monitoring and dialysis.

Past Medical History:
1) Hypertension
2) Stage V chronic kidney disease, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1366**].
3) Diastolic CHF (EF 60% on TTE in [**5-3**]), likely volume related
in the setting of her renal disease.
4) Rheumatic fever, with the following valvular abnormalities:
Mild aortic stenosis, moderate aortic regurgitation, mild mitral
stenosis, mild to moderate MR, mild TR.
5) Severe PA systolic hypertension
6) Renal artery stenosis:  MRI [**2185**] atrophic R kidney, moderate
stenosis of R renal artery, L renal artery normal.
7) Peripheral vascular disease:  Has claudication.

[**8-15**] CXR
FINDINGS:  AP view of the chest on upright position.  The
cardiac silhouette cannot be evaluated on this AP view.  The
right-sided central venous catheter is unchanged.  The left
costophrenic angle is blunted consistent with pleural effusions.
 Left lung base atelectasis are noted.  There is no evidence of
pneumothorax. There is a right lung base opacity obscuring the
right-side cardiac border which may represent right middle lobe
atelectasis vs. pneumonia. Pprominence of the pulmonary
vasculature is noted, consistent with mild CHF. The osseous
structures are unchanged.
  IMPRESSION:
1.  Right middle lobe atelectasis vs. pneumonia.
2.  Mild CHF with small left- sided pleural effusion.

[**8-15**] EKG
Sinus bradycardia at 56bpm, left axis, old RBBB, peaked T's that
are new compared to [**2194-6-24**] EKG. Inverted T in V3 on [**6-2**] EKG
has flipped to positive. No signs of acute ischemia.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Dyspnea - The patient's dyspnea was thought to be secondary
from volume overload, occuring in the context of ESRD and a
missed hemodialysis session, as well as hypertension leading to
flash pulmonary edema. Her dyspnea following hemodialysis.

2. Hypertension - The patient's hypertension is also likely
related to volume overload. Her blood pressures improved
following dialysis and resumption of her home course of toprol,

CXR [**2198-7-17**]:
Semi-upright portable AP view of the chest obtained.
Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly with diffuse ground-glass
haziness throughout the lungs compatible with pulmonary edema.
The right hemidiaphragm remains somewhat elevated and overall
low lung volumes are noted which somewhat limit the evaluation.
There are no large pleural effusions and no sign of
pneumothorax. Hilar engorgement is compatible with congestive
heart failure.  Bony structures appear intact.
IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema.

LHC [**2198-7-23**]:
1) Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system
demonstrated severe three vessel CAD. The LMCA was normal
without any
angiographically-apparent flow-limiting lesions. The stent in
the
proximal LAD had diffuse 60% in-stent restenosis. There was 80%
stenosis
throuhgout the proximal LCX, with a 60-70% stenosis at the
origin of the
OMB. The RCA had a 100% proximal stenosis with prominent
left-to-right
collaterals.
2) Resting hemodynamics showed elevated right and left-sided
filling
pressures with an RVEDP of 17 mmHg and an LVEDP of 27 mmHg. The
peak
gradient over the aortic valve was 14 mmHg. Using the Gorlin
equation,
the [**Location (un) 109**] was calculated to be 1.1 cm2, indicating moderate aortic

stenosis.
3) Left ventriculography was deferred.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate aortic stenosis.
3. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
4. Needs diuresis prior to cardioversion.
5. Consideration for AVR-CABG.

LENI [**2198-7-24**]: negative for DVT

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient underwent the usual preoperative work-up.  Dental
examined the patient and recommended extraction of one tooth.
The patient refused.
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2198-7-25**] where
the patient underwent AVR (tissue), CABG x 3, resection of left
atrial appendage with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Overall the patient tolerated
the procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the
CVICU in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
He does have a history of heart failure with an EF of 30% and
initially required multiple inotropes and vasopressors.  He
remained intubated due to pulmonary congestion, which improved
with diuresis.  Rapid a-fib developed and amiodarone drip was
initiated.  This was discontinued when rate was controlled.  He
failed a trial of Precedex.  He self-extubated and was
re-intubated without incident.  He developed a leukocytosis and
was started on cipro for a positive urinalysis.  There was no
growth on culture, and cipro was discontinued.  Tube feeds were
started on POD 3.  He was extubated on POD 4.  By this time, all
vasoactive drips had been weaned.  Coumadin was resumed for
chronic a-fib.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued
without complication.  Beta-blocker was initiated and the
patient was gently diuresed toward the pre-operative weight.
ACE Inhibitor was not initiated due to a rise in Creatinine,
which would start to trend down prior to discharge.  The patient
was evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance
with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD #10
the patient was ambulating freely, and pain was controlled with
oral analgesics. Due to upper and lower pole serosanguinous
sternal drainage, Mr.[**Known lastname 1884**] was placed on prophylactic
antibiotics x 1 week per Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **].  The patient was discharged  to
[**Hospital 100**] Rehab in good condition with appropriate follow up
instructions.

History of Present Illness:
76yo F with PAF s/p recent TEE-DCCV on [**4-21**], HTN, admitted with
hypoxic respiratory failure.  She was recently hospitalized from
[**Date range (1) 1919**] for a supratherapeutic INR of 16.  She was in AF with
a ventricular rate of 110s-140s, asymptomatic.  Medical
management of her AF was initially tried.  She was maintained on
her atenolol and propafenone, and diltiazem was added.  The
decision was then made to pursue cardioversion instead.
TEE-DCCV was performed on [**2112-4-21**].  She was in sinus rhythm
after the procedure and had a HR in the 50s on atenolol and
propafenone upon discharge.  The diltiazem had been discontinued
secondary to bradycardia post-procedure.  She was also
discharged on Coumadin 1mg qhs.  Her family states her symptoms
began just prior to discharge, when she began to feel short of
breath and fatigued.  Her symptoms progressively worsened at
home.  She was seen in [**Company 191**] the next morning and was found to
have O2 sats in the 80s, so she was sent to the ED.
.
In the ED, her T was 100.6, HR 70s in NSR, and she was 84% on

EKG: NSR at 72, normal axis and intervals, T wave flattening in
aVL, peaked Ts on V3-V6, no ST segment changes
.
CXR: continued moderate-to-severe pulmonary interstitial edema
with bilateral pleural effusions, no evidence of pneumothorax
.
TEE ([**4-21**]): The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left
atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Left ventricular cavity size, and systolic function are
normal. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch and
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-25**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
Stress echo ([**9-25**]): Good functional exercise capacity. No ECG or
2D echocardiographic evidence of inducible ischemia to achieved
workload. Mildly blunted hemodynamic response to exercise. Mild
mitral regurgitation. Limited study. Target HR not achieved.

Brief Hospital Course:
.
# Dyspnea: Her shortness of breath and respiratory failure were
thought secondary to  pulmonary edema.  The pulmonary edema
likely followed an indolent course, with her rapid atrial
fibrillation and diastolic dysfunction causing progressive
volume overload.  Her acute exacerbation was likely due to
post-cardioversion pulmonary edema.  She initially had a
low-grade fever, but pneumonia was thought less likely, and her
chest x-ray was without infiltrate.  She had normal cardiac
enzymes, so ischemia was not a contributing factor.  She was
maintained on a beta blocker and ACE-inhibitor.  After
aggressive diuresis, she was weaned off mechanical ventilation
quickly.  Diuresis was continued with prn IV Lasix, and she had
resolution of her dyspnea and oxygen requirement.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: She was in sinus rhythm on admission, and
was initially maintained on propafenone and metoprolol.  On [**4-23**],
she converted to atrial fibrillation and had a rapid ventricular
response in the 140s.  She underwent DC cardioversion, after
which she became hypotensive and bradycardic, requiring
transient treatment with dopamine.  She was continued on
propafenone after the DCCV.  On the morning of [**4-26**], she
converted into atrial fibrillation again, with rates of 140s.
She had a normal blood pressure and some mild palpitations.  She
was initially loaded with po amiodarone, with slowing of her
heart rates to the 100s to 110s.  When her heart rate began to
trend up again, she was loaded with IV amiodarone and started on
a drip.  Her rates remained in the 100s to 110s.  She was
transitioned to po amiodarone on the night of [**4-26**].  She
experienced nausea and vomiting on po amiodarone.  She underwent
another cardioversion on [**4-29**] but reverted back to atrial
fibrillation the next day.  She was continued on amiodarone but
remained in atrial fibrillation.  She went into rapid
ventricular response in the 150s on [**5-1**], requiring IV diltiazem
to bring her rate down.  She was started on po diltiazem, which
was quickly titrated up with her heart rate decreasing to the
80s.  The diltiazem was stopped the morning of [**5-3**], just before
she underwent another cardioversion.  She remained in sinus
rhythm for the rest of her stay.  She was discharged on
amiodarone 200mg po three times daily, with a follow up
appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1911**].  Anticoagulation as below.
.
# Elevated INR:  INR went from 4 on [**4-21**] to 9 on [**4-22**] with only
1 mg of Coumadin.  Last admission was for INR of 16 on Coumadin
4mg qhs.  Received 5mg vitamin K SC in the ED.  Repeat coags on
the floor showed INR of 11, would have expected some decline
with SC vitamin K.  Her INR decreased to 4.5 with FFP.  Her INR
then decreased to normal.  Hematology was consulted and felt she
could potentially have a partial clotting factor deficiency
causing her severe sensitivity to Coumadin.  Her Coumadin was
held throughout most of her stay, and she was maintained on IV
heparin.  Coumadin was restarted at 0.5mg on [**5-3**] after her
cardioversion.  Her INR remained subtherapeutic after 2 doses.
She was discharged on Coumadin 0.5mg qhs with a Lovenox bridge,
with an INR check 4 days after discharge.  She is to follow up
with her PCP to consider Hematology follow up.

Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP with sphincterotomy and biliary stent placement on [**2157-2-1**]

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known firstname 1929**] [**Known lastname 1930**] is a very nice 85 year-old woman with a
history of cholecystectomy and ampullar stenosis who presents
with RUQ abdominal pain. She states her pain started 2 days
prior to admission, was constant and radiated towards the back.
She had nausea, vomit, malaise.  Denies fever, chills, changes
in her bowel movements, hematochezia or melena.  Unable able to
tolerate oral intake.

Presenting vitals were T 101.5, HR 68, BP 152/76, RR 16, SpO2
95% RA.  In ED, Unasyn 3gm given and a right IJ central line was
placed. She underwent ERCP that showed 1-cm stone in the common
bile duct. Patient became hypoxic from the conscious sedation,
so the stone was not removed to expedite the procedure. A
plastic biliary stent was successfully placed.  Post-ERCP, she
was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of cholangitis.

ICU course:  In the ICU, the patient was continued on Zosyn, her
RUQ pain significantly improved, and she began to tolerate
fluids.  On [**2-3**], she developed shortness of breath that
improved with administration of furosemide.  Nebulizer
treatments also given.  At time of transfer to floor, O2 sat was
95% on 2L nasal canula.  Lisinopril restarted, but Atenolol and
Nifedipine held for concern of lower heart rate.

She was transferred to the floor and felt improvement in her
abdominal pain.  Denied shortness of breath, chest pain.

ERCP [**2157-2-1**]:
Findings: Esophagus: Limited exam of the esophagus was normal
Stomach: Limited exam of the stomach was normal
Duodenum: Limited exam of the duodenum was normal
Major Papilla: Evidence of a previous wide open sphincterotomy
was noted in the major papilla. Pus was noted at the ampulla.
Cannulation:  Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and
deep using a free-hand technique. Contrast medium was injected
resulting in complete opacification.

Biliary Tree: A single 15 mm stone that was causing partial
obstruction was seen at the lower third of the common bile duct.
The bile duct was dilated to 15 mm. The rest of the biliary tree
was normal. Detailed cholangiogram was not obtained due to
suspicion of cholangitis.
Procedures: A 5cm by 10FR Double pig-tail biliary stent was
placed successfully.

Impression: S/P sphincterotomy - this was widely patent.
Pus noted at the ampulla.
Stone at the lower third of the common bile duct, dilation of
bile duct to 15 mm, other normal biliary tree.
A double pig-tail stent was placed in the bile duct.

Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum

TTE [**2-8**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrial pressure is
indeterminate. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the aortic valve. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
mitral valve. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling
abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation
is seen. The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is
increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
85 year-old woman presents with cholangitis [**12-21**]
choledocholithiasis s/p ERCP with biliary stent placement.
Gallstone was not removed because of the patient's tenous
condition.  The plan will be to repeat the ERCP in one month to
remove the stone.  Patient was also with bacteremia with E. Coli
and Enterococcus likely [**12-21**] biliary source.  Patient initially
on Zosyn, but because of thrombocytopenia was changed over to
Vanco and Cipro.  This was finally changed to ampicillin when
susceptibilities resulted.

# Cholangitis: RUQ pain, fever, leukocytosis with bandemia, AST
979, ALT 723, AP 120, TB 3.5 and direct of 2.4. ERCP was
performed and a double pigtail plastic stent was placed. Her
hemodynamics remained stable. Blood cultures were positive for
gram negative rods, and she was treated with IV Zosyn.
Hepatitis serologies demonstrated previous hepatitis A exposure.
 She developed bacteremia (see below) and will continue
antibiotics until [**2-16**].  She will need ERCP follow up in 1 month
for repeat ERCP and stent placement.

# E. Coli and Enterococcus bacteremia both susceptible to
Ampicillin.  Pt initially on Zosyn, then changed to Vanco and
Ciprofloxacin given thrombocytopenia.  ID was consulted and did
not recommend cardiac imaging given that the likely source was
the biliary tree and surveillance cultures were negative.  She
was converted to ampicillin and should continue a 14 day course
since last negative culture ([**Date range (3) 1933**]).

# Shortness of breath likely [**12-21**] fluid overload: Patient was
intermittently tachypneic and wheezing and was treated with
albuterol nebs and lasix with improvement.  ECHO ordered to
evaluate for systolic or diastolic dysfunction.  She was found
to have restrictive filling pressures and elevated [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1934**].
 She will be discharged on lasix 10mg daily until she sees her
PMD.  She will need cardiology follow up given her disease.

# Thrombocytopenia: PLTs decreased to 83 ([**2-3**]) from 182 on
admission. Pt not on heparin, thought to be [**12-21**] sepsis at
admission. Hemolysis labs not concerning for DIC, and less
likely thought to be due to ITP or TTP. After discontinuation of
Zosyn, the platelets increased and remained stable. On
discharge, her platelets were 252.

# Hypertension: Lisinopril restarted in ICU. Atenolol and
Nifedipine restarted on the floor.  Blood pressures were well
controlled on the floor.

# GERD: Pantoprazole was started.

# Parkinson's disease: Continued Carbidopa-Levodopa

# Diverticulosis: Stable.  Guaiac negative stools.

77 y/o F with PMhx of Developmental Delay, COPD, HL, HTN and
Mirizzi syndrome who presented today for elective ERCP.  Pt was
felt to be functionning at baseline prior to procedure with mild
agitation, pulling at PIVs but interacting with staff.  She was
given fent/midaz for ERCP with stent placement and was
transferred to the post-ERCP suite in stable condition. She had
elevated BPs during the procedure requiring labetalol and
metoprolol. She was found mildly tachypneic/wheezing with emesis
on her gown. It was felt likely that she had an aspiration event
with low grade temp  However, she was still moving all four
extremities and responding appropriately to questions though
mildly sedated prior to transfer to the floor.
.
On arrival to the floor, pt was minimally responsive to sternal
rub and did not withdraw to focal stimuli.  She was notably
tachypneic and eyes were deviated to right side.  She was able
to track to left with stimuli and would intermittently open eyes
to command.   Pt had an ABG 7.4/36/92 with lactate of 3.5 and
CXR showed a right lower lobe infiltrate.  Due to concern for
acute intracranial hemmorrhage, she was taken down for a stat CT
head.  On return to the floor, pt was given narcan without any
significant change in mental status.  Neuro was consulted for
possible acute stroke and within a few minutes, she became more
responsive, opening eyes spontaneously. By the time neuro came
to bedside, pt was able to verbalize her name and was noted to
be using the right arm and had left sided deficit.  A CODE
stroke was called and pt was taken for urgent CTA head which did
not show any vessel obstruction and TPA was felt unlikely to be
helpful.  Perfusion images confirmed right temporal
hypoperfusion consistent with clinical exam and likely right MCA
infarct.  ICU consult was initiated and pt's guardian was
notified.  Pt was given Vanc/Cefepime and Aspirin 300mg PR while
awaiting ICU transfer.  She was lying flat per neuro recs and
was noted to be spitting up bilious emesis.  Head of bed was
elevated and pt was suctionned prior to transferred to the ICU
for closer monitoring of airway and management of acute
pneumonia.

Past Medical History:

ERCP [**2182-10-17**]
Procedures: A plastic stent was removed.
Impression: 2 balloon sweeps were performed with a small stone,
sludge and debris removed. A 1.5 cm biliary stricture in mid-CBD
compatible with known cystic duct stone and mirrizi syndrome was
visualized. A 10 F 5cm double pigtailed catheter was placed.
Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum.

output.
.
Cardiac Echo: IMPRESSION: Small LV cavity size with mild
symmetric LVH and hyperdynamic LV systolic function.
Consequently, there is a mild to moderate LV outflow tract

Brief Hospital Course:
77 y/o F with PMhx of Developmental Delay, COPD, HL, HTN and
Mirizzi syndrome who presented on [**10-17**] for elective ERCP. Pt
was noted to have emesis on her gown in the post procedure suite
with diffuse wheezes and low grade temp. It was thought likely
that she had an aspiration event and when she was arrived on the
floor, she had a profoundly depressed mental status, tachypnea
and fever to 101.9.  Further stat work up revealed evidence of
aspiration PNA, leukocytosis and elevated lactate.  Initial head
imaging was unrevealing. However, she became more alert and was
noted to have an acute left sided deficit. CODE STROKE was
called and CTA/perfusion images confirmed right sided
hypoperfusion likely consistent with right MCA stroke.  Neuro
felt there was no indication for TPA given patent intracranial
vessels and on return to the floor, pt was noted to have bilious
secretions that she was having difficulty clearing.  She was
transferred to the ICU for airway monitoring overnight. Pt was
called out to the floor when she was able to cough and spit up
secretions.  She was noted to have a waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental
status, sometimes will respond to commands and other times will
not.  BP was allowed to autoregulate for the first 72 hrs post
event and pt was continued on Aspirin 300mg daily.  She was
noted to have recovery of left arm function and was answering
yes/no to questions.

She was seen by PT/OT who recommended ongoing therapy upon
return to NH.
After discussion with HCP/guardian, decision was made to avoid
follow up MRI as it was not likely to change care plan and pt
was unlikely to tolerate the procedure.  Echo was performed to
rule out cardioembolic source which did not show any thrombus.
Lipid panel showed LDL in the 93, and Hgb A1c 9.4.  She was
hyperglycemic during the hospitalization, and she was started on
Lantus and sliding scale insulin.
.
Aspiration PNA: Pt was noted to have aspiration event s/p
procedure and was monitored in the ICU for 24hrs given concern
for her ability to protect airway .  Leukocytosis, lactate and
fevers resolved after initiation of Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl.
Respiratory status improved and pt had a PICC placed and she
completed a course of antibiotics.

Upper Extremity DVT- Patient was subsequently developed a DVT
associated with the PICC line. The PICC line was discontinued
and she was started on Lovenox.  Once a PEG tube was placed, she
was started on Warfarin for a goal INR of [**2-6**].  Please follow
INR closely and titrate prn.  She received her first dose of
Warfarin 5 mg on [**11-2**].

Aspiration - Pt was seen by speach/swallow on multiple
occasions, which she grossly failed with aspiration.  She was
kept strictly NPO, and she was maintained with IV medications
and hydration.  A dobhoff was placed for initiation of tube
feeds, while waiting to see if she would regain her swallow
function.  It is/was hoped that her swallow function would
improve, especially considering her significant recovery in her
left arm movement, however, she did not show significant
improvement on serial exams.  In discussion with Speech and
Swallow, however, there is some hope that she may recover her
swallow on a long term basis, and Swallow therapy may help with
this recovery.  They suggested an approximate 50% chance of
recovery to the point of safe oral intake in the long-term.
.
Diabetes-Pt with uncontrolled hyperglycemia after the initiation
of tube feeds. Her lantus and insulin sliding scales were
agressively increased. She is being discharged on 70 units of
lantus, and a sliding scale.
.
Mirizzi Syndrome s/p ERCP: Pt with abnormal biliary anatomy who
underwent stent and sphincteroplastyon [**10-17**] for recurrent abd
pain. She was noted to have an acute rise in transaminases post
procedure and these trended down with normal Tbili.  Pt was
followed by ERCP team while in house.
.
Developmental Delay: baseline confirmed with her guardian/mother
and nursing home.
.
HTN: held BP meds to allow autoregulation s/p stroke. She was
subsequently treated with IV metoprolol, clonidine patch, and IV
lasix, with benefit. After obtaining access via PEG, a blood
pressure medication regimen via PEG was begun. I expect that she
will benefit from further titration of medications as an
outpatient.  Please note that she was also started on
Lisinopril; please follow up lytes in 1 week to ensure she
tolerates.
.
Hyperlipidemia: Patient's simvastatin was held while patient was
NPO. This was resumed after obtaining access via PEG. This
medication dose was increased to 40 mg for goal LDL <70
considering diabetes and stroke.  Please follow up LFT's to
ensure tolerating, and lipid profile to ensure she meets her
targets.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
80 yo F w/ DM2, HTN, PA HTN p/w SOB and LE edema x1 week, now
with severe anemia
(hct of 17 noted by her PCP) thought to be secondary to UGIB,
hemodynamically stable s/p 6 Units of bld w/ increase of hct to
30. serial hcts q 6 hrs remained stable at 30.

Pt had EGD in ED ([**2132-9-5**]) which revealed granularity,
friability and erythema in the stomach body, fundus and antrum
compatible with acute gastritis (biopsy obtained). Erythema in
the duodenal bulb compatible with duodenitis. Ulcer in the
distal bulb. Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the
duodenum.

Echo:([**2132-8-23**])
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%).
3. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
5. Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed)
of [**2128-8-18**], there has been no significant change.

1. GIB with increased BUN, likely UGIB, however LGIB initially
considered as well.
Pt had 2 large bore IV's placed.  NG lavage was positive as well
as stool guiacs. EGD as above. No active bleed noted however
ulcer and gastritis likely source of anemia. Ulcer thought to be
secondary to NSAID use vs H. pylori.  Will treat for H.Pylori if
indicated. Pt will follow up with GI. ASA was held secondary to
bleed.  Losartan was initially held, then restarted at half
normal dose. NSAIDs were avoided. Initially given IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
which was then changed to po. Colonoscopy performed was reported
to be normal.

2. Cardiac. EKG changes (NSR at 84, Nl axis and intervals, TWI
III, TWI V1-V4). Pt was ruled out for MI with three sets of neg
cardiac enzymes. She denied CP. ECG changes likely secondary to
demand ischemia from severe anemia. She was initially monitored
on tele with no events. An echo done on [**2132-8-23**], as above
(LVEF>55%). SOB most likely due to discontinuation of lasix for
one week in setting of diastolic CHF. Treated with 40 of lasix
IV (held off on diuresis intially secondary to concern for GI
bld).

3. Resp. CXR done on [**2132-9-5**] without overt evidence of CHF or
pneumonia. Findings suggestive of pulmonary artery hypertension.
 She required O2 supplementation during her stay and was noted
to have RA sats in the 80's with ambulation likely secondary to
PA HTN. She was sent home on supplemental O2. A Repeat cxr was
suggestive of pulm congestion. Lasix given as above.

4. DM2. Initially bld sugars controlled with RISS, oral
hyperglycemics were restarted prior to discharge.

5. Anemia secondary to gastritis and PUD, as well as Fe/Vit B12
def. She was transfused a total of 6 Units of PRBC's and her hct
was monitored q 6 hrs. She was started on Vit B12
supplementation. She was continued on Niferex.

C-SPINE NON-TRAUMA W/FLEX & EXT 4 VIEWS  [**2134-3-8**] 3:46 PM
IMPRESSION: Limited evaluation of the c-spine, with limited
range of motion. No listhesis seen on these views.
.
MR L SPINE SCAN  [**2134-2-27**] 10:09 PM
IMPRESSION:
Spinal stenosis noted at the level of L3-4 and L4-5 as discussed
above.
.
MR BRACHIAL PLEXUS; MR CONTRAST GADOLIN
IMPRESSION:
1. Thickening and ill-definition of the right brachial plexus
just lateral to the superior ribs and inferior to the
subscapularis muscle immediately below the coracoid process,
likely secondary to trauma. No mass or hematoma impinging upon
the nerves within the axilla or medially. The appearance of the
nerves as they course by the proximal humeral shaft fracture is
not well evaluated on this study as it is too peripheral.
2. Humeral shaft fracture and hemorrhage within the subcoracoid
bursa not completely evaluated on this study.
3. Cervical spine disc degeneration seen on cervical spine MR.
[**Name13 (STitle) **] thoracic injury seen on prior imaging of uncertain cause.
.
HAND (AP, LAT & OBLIQUE) RIGHT  [**2134-2-16**] 5:46 PM
THREE VIEWS OF THE RIGHT HAND: There is diffuse osseous
demineralization. There are degenerative changes with no
definite fracture. Joint spaces are preserved.
THREE VIEWS OF THE RIGHT WRIST: Alignment is normal. No
fractures are identified. There are multiple rounded calcific
bodies in the dorsal soft tissues that do not appear to be
fracture fragments.
THREE VIEWS OF THE RIGHT ELBOW: Alignment is normal. No
fractures are identified. There is an enthesophyte at the
posterior olecranon.
.
C-spine CT: There is no evidence of cervical spine fracture.
Bulky
calcifications of the posterior longitudinal ligament are
identified at the C2-4 levels, likely resulting in moderate
spinal stenosis.  Multilevel degenerative changes are identified
with disc space and osteophyte formation. Bridging osteophytes
are identified at C7-T2.  The T1-3 processes appear fused.
There is marked irregularity of the inferior endplate of T3 and
superior endplate of T4 with impaction of these vertebral bodies
onto each other and acute kyphotic angulation at this level.
These findings are likely chronic.  There is no prevertebral
soft tissue swelling.  The lung apices are clear.
IMPRESSION:  No acute cervical spine fracture.  Extensive
degenerative changes as described above.
.
Head CT: FINDINGS:  There is hyperdensity along the left frontal
vertex that is likely secondary to volume averaging.  There is
no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect,
hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures or major
vascular territorial infarction.  Hypodensity in the
periventricular cerebral white matter is consistent with chronic
microvascular ischemia. Small prior infarcts are identified in
the right internal capsule basal ganglia and left external
capsule.  Surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures are
unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
.
Bilateral Hip films: Degenerative changes with no definite
fracture.
.
CTA: Impression:
1. no PE
2. enlarged pulmonary arteries
3. lymphadenopathy in mediastinum some of which are calcified
4. calcified hilar lymph nodes
5. pulm lymph nodes along major and minor fissures bilaterally
6. fat density structures in liver and stomach
.
EKG: afib/atach with no ST-T changes. new TWI in III.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color
Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
systolic function
are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion
appears normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not
present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The

Brief Hospital Course:
Summary:
Briefly, this is a 81 year old Russian speaking woman who
presented status post fall.  No intracranial bleed. No hip
fracture. + R humerus fracture. CT of c-spine showed severe
stenosis. She was initially admitted to the medicine service for
workup of syncope; neurology was consulted for a weak right arm
following R humeral fracture and she was found to have a mixed
central cord and Brown-Sequard syndrome and transferred to the
neurology service for closer exam monitoring.  She underwent  R
humerus ORIF and C2-C6 laminectomy and fusion on [**2134-3-2**]. A med
consult was obtained on [**2134-3-4**] for persistent hypoxia. She was
gently diuresed, and had serial ABG's which showed persistent
hypercarbia. During the admission, she was also treated with
Cipro for a UTI.
.
Neuro: The patient could not recall the events surrounding the
fall and sustained a spiral fracture to the right proximal
humerus, displaced, and had bilateral arm weakness and numbness
distally in all 4 extremities.  On exam she initially was found
to have evidence of a central cord syndrome with weakness
affecting arms more so than legs.  She also had evidence of a
brown sequard given that weakness and proprioception are down on
the right with an upgoing toe, and pin sensation is down on the
left, sensory level of C4/T3 anteriorly on the left (where the
two dermatomes meet at the top of the breast).  She was
complaining of neck pain, and had had trouble voiding so a foley
was placed.
.
MRI of the C-spine was performed for the likelihood of acute
spinal cord injury with above findings.  Read of MRI was: ""Bulky
ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament at C2/3,
C3/4, and C4/5 levels, more than the right, causing severe
spinal canal stenosis.The cervical cord at those levels is
deformed and compressed, demonstrating intrinsic T2 hyperintense
signal.  There is also a fracture at the inferior endplate of C3
anteriorly.""  She was placed in a hard cervical collar and pain
was controlled with morphine and ibuprofen initially.  She was
seen by both neurosurgery and orthopedics for the injury as both
services had been alternately covering the spine service in the
hospital.  Orthopedics also followed her for the broken right
humerus, and neurosurgery had initially been consulted in the ED
when a head ct showed the question of a subdural hematoma (later
proven to be artifactual).
.
Both [**Date Range **] and neurosurgery agreed that it was safest for the
patient to hold off on the spine surgery for at least a week to
allow cord swelling to heal before operating.  She remained in a
hard collar during this time and her exam improved over the next
week; the pinprick sensory level retracted to the T12 region for
days, then finally seemed to vanish altogether; the
proprioceptive changes on the right also resolved.  Although the
right arm remained weak and flaccid with just [**2-28**] finger flexors
and trapezius/shoulder shrug [**2-28**] (initially thought just limited
by pain versus multiple nerve injury), the left arm strength
improved to deltoid [**3-31**], [**Hospital1 **]/tri both 4+ to 5-/5, and wrist and
finger extensors 4+/5; finger flexors were also 4+/5.  On [**4-9**]: there were no changes in exam.  For neuropathic pain,
neurontin had been initiated (patient later requested d/c to
simplify med regimen).
.
The weekend of [**2-27**] on morning rounds, a mild right Horner's
syndrome was noted which had not been picked up before on daily
rounds.  This, along with the flaccid arm, was suggestive of
root avulsion on the right (and associated plexopathy).
Her neurologic symptoms all gradually resolved during
hospitalization.
.
[**Date Range 1957**]:
Pt underwent R humerus ORIF and cervical laminectomy (report
below), however pt post-op, the medicine service was consulted
for hypoxia (pt required 50% shovel mask) and hypercarbia (pCO2
in high 50's). She has a follow up appointment on [**3-18**] with
[**Month/Year (2) **] to evaluate her fracture and decide whether her C-collar
can be removed.
.
Hypoxia/hypercarbia:
Pt had hx of severe pulm HTM, likely [**1-28**] PDA. ABG showed mild
CO2 retention, ? if this was close to her baseline. Also likely
had component of fluid overload, given recent surgery.  Pt was
gently diuresed with IV Lasix. Narcotics were d/c'd as pt
appeared somnolent. O2 was successfully weaned down to 2L NC (pt
apparently had been on 2L O2 at home). CTA on admission was
negative for PE, and the suspicion for PE was fairly low post-op
given that the pt was not tachycardic and her oxygen requirement
improved.  Therefore, repeat CTA was not done. She was also
noted to be hypercarbic during admission, but her respiratory
status remained stable while on the medicine service.
.
Status post fall: The original fall was of unclear etiology. The
differential included vasovagal syncope versus new onset
afib/atach versus mechanical given loss of consciousness. Less
likely include myocardial infarction/ischemia versus pulmonary
embolism versus seizure. Also less likely hypoglycemia given
timing after meal although patinet on glyburide which is renally
cleared in setting of increased creatinine.  The patient ruled
out for MI by cardiac enzymes, echo showed no obvious severe
valvular disease to explain ?syncopal event, though telemetry
showed periodic tachyarrhythmia ?sinus tach vs afib.  She had no
other significant tele events while in the hospital.
.
Elevated WBC and lactate at admission: unclear etiology,
afebrile with negative UA and infectious workup at admission.
This cleared on its own.  Later in hospitalization ([**2-27**]) she had
a UTI treated with course of ciprofloxacin. Urine cxlood cx, and
cath tip cx were sent prior to d/c to workup somnolence, however
pt's somnolence cleared and cx's were pending on d/c. These
should be followed at her follow up appointments.
.
Musculoskeletal: initially, radiographic imaging was negative
for fracture or bleed including right UE, hips bilaterally,
c-spine and head. Patient with known chronic low back pain and
sciatica.
.
Hypertension/pulmonary hypertension: continued ASA, held
valsartan. lasix initially held for renal failure but was
restarted once she was clinically stable.
.
Hypercholesterolemia: continued home dose of lipitor
.
Renal: She has slight renal insufficiency at admission and was
given gentle IVF. Her electrolytes were followed and repleted as
needed, MVI and continued niferex.  ARF improved. She should
have her potassium and BUN/creatinine followed at regular
intervals starting 2-3 days post discharge, as she was
discharged on her home dose of [**Last Name (un) **] and new dose of lasix.

Prophylaxis: The patient was maintained on TEDS, SQ heparin,
PPI, bowel regimen.  She complained of RLE pain one day, and u/s
was ordered to r/o dvt - this study was negative.

PROCEDURE:  IM nail right humerus.

ASSISTANT:  [**Last Name (un) 1965**].

INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 81-year-old
woman who sustained a fall and has a displaced right proximal
humerus fracture. She also has a spine injury and this has
been operated on by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1966**]. Given the displacement of
her fracture and that she is having pain and not tolerating
nonoperative treatment, we decided to proceed with
intramedullary nailing.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  After informed consent was
obtained and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1967**] had completed his spinal portion
of the case, the patient was placed in the supine position.
The right arm was prepped and draped in normal sterile
fashion.

A 3 cm incision was made over the proximal humerus and the
deltoid was split. Eentry point was established in the
proximal humerus and the guide wire placed. The fracture was
held reduced and the guide wire passed into the distal
humerus. The proximal part of the humerus was reamed and
then the canal was reamed up to a size 10 mm. Next a 230 by
10 mm [**Doctor Last Name 1968**] and Nephew nail was placed and interlocked with 2
screws proximally. The distal locking screw was placed under
image intensification. Wounds were irrigated and closed with
0 Vicryl, 2-0 and a subcuticular 3-0. Postoperatively, she
was brought back to the recovery room in stable condition.

COMPLICATIONS:  None.

As the attending surgeon I was present for and performed the
entire procedure.
